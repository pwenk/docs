description: 'How to maintain without obsessing, recover from setbacks, and live your life'
---

**Time to Complete:** 45 minutes

**Priority:** MOST IMPORTANT ⭐⭐⭐

<Info>
  **This is the most important module.**

  Anyone can do 8 weeks of perfection. Few can sustain this for life.

  This module teaches you how.
</Info>

## What You'll Learn

- How to maintain without obsessing
- When to experiment vs when to stabilize
- Seasonal adjustments
- Life happens (how to recover)
- Never stop listening to your body
- Don't become a zealot

## The Long-Term Mindset

You've spent 8 weeks:
- Eliminating PUFAs
- Tracking body signals
- Running experiments
- Building your protocol

**Now what?**

### Two Paths

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Path 1: Obsession (Don't Do This)">
    - Track every detail forever
    - Stress about every meal
    - Avoid all social situations
    - Become rigid and dogmatic
    - Make food your identity

    **Result:** Metabolic improvement, but psychological damage. Unsustainable.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Path 2: Practice (Do This)">
    - Monitor key signals (temperature, energy)
    - Follow your protocol 90% of the time
    - Stay flexible in social situations
    - Experiment occasionally
    - Live your life without food anxiety

    **Result:** Sustained metabolic health, psychological freedom. Sustainable for life.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

**Choose Path 2.**

## The 90/10 Rule (Revisited)

This is the key to long-term success.

### What 90/10 Means

**90% of the time (at home, normal life):**
- Zero seed oils
- Follow your personal protocol
- Track key signals weekly (not daily)
- Make decisions based on body awareness

**10% of the time (social, travel, life):**
- Do your best
- Make better choices when possible
- Don't stress about unavoidable seed oils
- Enjoy your life

### Why This Works

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="90% Gives You 90% of the Benefits">
    You don't need perfection to heal your metabolism.

    **90% PUFA elimination:**
    - Cells gradually replace damaged membranes
    - Thyroid function improves
    - Energy stabilizes
    - Weight normalizes

    **The last 10% isn't worth the stress.**
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Stress Damages Metabolism More Than Occasional PUFAs">
    Chronic stress (from food anxiety):
    - Raises cortisol
    - Suppresses thyroid
    - Blocks digestion
    - Damages metabolic health

    **One meal with seed oils < chronic stress about food**
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Sustainability Beats Intensity">
    **Scenario A:**
    - 100% compliance for 3 months
    - Burnout and quit
    - Return to old habits

    **Scenario B:**
    - 90% compliance for years
    - Sustainable, flexible, enjoyable
    - Lifelong metabolic health

    **Which is better?**
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Life Is Meant to Be Lived">
    Food is important. But it's not everything.

    **Also important:**
    - Relationships
    - Joy
    - Community
    - Freedom

    Don't sacrifice those for perfect macros.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## How to Maintain Without Obsessing

You don't need to track everything forever.

### What to Track Long-Term

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Weekly (Minimal Tracking)">
    **Body temperature:**
    - 1-2x per week (morning temp)
    - As long as it's 97.8°F+, you're good

    **Energy:**
    - Do I have stable energy most days?
    - Am I sleeping well?

    **Digestion:**
    - Regular and comfortable?

    **That's it.**

    If these are good, your protocol is working.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Monthly (Reflection)">
    Once a month, ask:
    - Is my temperature still good?
    - Is my energy stable?
    - Am I tolerating my protocol well?
    - Do I need to adjust anything?

    **10-minute monthly check-in.**
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Stop Daily Tracking (After 8 Weeks)">
    You've built body awareness.

    **You don't need to write down:**
    - Every meal
    - Every temperature reading
    - Every experiment

    **You'll just know.**

    Track only when:
    - Signals change (temp drops, energy crashes)
    - You're running a new experiment
    - Something feels off
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## When to Experiment vs When to Stabilize

Not every phase of life requires experimentation.

### When to Experiment

**Run new experiments when:**
- You've stabilized and want to optimize further
- You've hit a plateau
- Life circumstances change (new job, increased activity, etc.)
- You're curious about something

**1-2 experiments per quarter is plenty.**

### When to Stabilize

**Stick with your protocol when:**
- Life is stressful (don't add food stress on top)
- You're traveling or dealing with major changes
- Your signals are good and stable
- You're happy with how you feel

**Sometimes the best experiment is no experiment.**

## Seasonal Adjustments

Your body's needs change with seasons.

### Common Seasonal Patterns

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Winter">
    **Common needs:**
    - More carbs (body temperature regulation)
    - More fat (calorie density for warmth)
    - Heavier foods (soups, stews, roasts)

    **Adjustments to try:**
    - Increase carbs by 50g/day
    - Add more warm, cooked foods
    - Increase salt slightly (if heating dries you out)
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Summer">
    **Common needs:**
    - More hydration
    - Lighter foods (salads, fruit, less fat)
    - Higher activity = more food

    **Adjustments to try:**
    - More fruit and fresh foods
    - Slightly lower fat (you'll naturally crave less)
    - Increase salt and water (sweating more)
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Spring/Fall (Transition)">
    **Common needs:**
    - Balance between heavy and light
    - May need less food (if activity decreases)

    **Adjustments:**
    - Listen to cravings (body knows what it needs)
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

**Your protocol should adapt to your environment.**

## Life Happens: How to Recover

You WILL have periods where you fall off track.

### Common Life Disruptors

- Travel
- Holidays
- Illness
- Major stress (job change, moving, family crisis)
- Injury
- Pregnancy/postpartum

**These are normal. They don't mean you've failed.**

### How to Recover

<Steps>
  <Step title="Don't Panic">
    One week (or even one month) off your protocol won't undo months of healing.

    **Your body is resilient.**
  </Step>

  <Step title="Return to Basics">
    Don't try to "make up for it" with extreme measures.

    Just return to:
    - Zero seed oils (or close to it)
    - Eating enough carbs
    - Regular meals
    - Tracking temperature

    **That's it.**
  </Step>

  <Step title="Give It Time">
    It might take 1-2 weeks to feel normal again.

    **Be patient.**
  </Step>

  <Step title="Learn from It">
    Ask yourself:
    - What happened?
    - What triggered the slip?
    - How can I prepare better next time?

    **Not with judgment. With curiosity.**
  </Step>

  <Step title="Move Forward">
    Don't dwell on the past.

    **The next meal is a new opportunity.**
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Never Stop Listening to Your Body

This is the core of long-term maintenance.

### Your Body Signals Are Your Guide

**As long as you're checking in with:**
- Temperature (weekly)
- Energy (daily awareness)
- Digestion (how you feel)
- Mood (stable or anxious)

**You'll know if your protocol needs adjusting.**

### Trust Your Instincts

After 8 weeks of tracking, you've built a strong connection with your body.

**You'll notice when:**
- You need more food
- You need more carbs
- You're overtraining
- You're under-sleeping
- Something isn't working

**Trust that. Adjust accordingly.**

## Don't Become a Zealot

This is important.

### The Zealot Trap

When people experience transformation, they often become:
- Dogmatic (my way is the only way)
- Preachy (everyone must do this)
- Judgmental (people eating seed oils are ignorant)
- Identity-fused (this diet is who I am)

**Don't do this.**

### Why Zealotry Fails

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="It Alienates People">
    No one wants to be lectured.

    **If you preach, people will avoid you and dismiss your message.**
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="It Creates Rigidity">
    Zealots can't adapt when new information emerges.

    **This is supposed to be a practice of curiosity, not dogma.**
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="It's Exhausting">
    Making food your identity is draining.

    **You'll burn out.**
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="You Might Be Wrong">
    Science evolves. Your body changes. What works now might not work forever.

    **Stay humble.**
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### How to Share Without Preaching

**If someone asks:**
- Share your experience ("This worked for me")
- Offer resources ("Here's where you can learn more")
- Respect their choice ("It's not for everyone")

**If they don't ask:**
- Don't bring it up
- Just live your life
- Let your results speak

**Your health is the best advertisement.**

## The Maintenance Protocol

Here's your ongoing structure.

### Daily (Minimal Effort)

- Eat according to your protocol (90% of the time)
- Notice: How do I feel? (quick awareness check)

**5 minutes total.**

### Weekly

- Check temperature 1-2x
- Reflect: Is my protocol still working?

**10 minutes total.**

### Monthly

- Review body signals (temp, energy, digestion, mood)
- Decide: Do I need to adjust anything?

**15-20 minutes total.**

### Quarterly (Every 3 Months)

- Run 1-2 new experiments (if desired)
- Reassess your protocol
- Check: Am I still enjoying this?

**1 hour total.**

**Total time investment: 1-2 hours per month.**

**That's sustainable.**
