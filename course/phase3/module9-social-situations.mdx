**Time to Complete:** 30 minutes

**Priority:** Important ‚≠ê

## What You'll Learn

- How to order at restaurants without being weird
- Dealing with family dinners and judgment
- Staying on track while traveling
- The 90/10 rule (perfection kills progress)

## The Problem

You can control your kitchen. You can't control the world.

**Social eating is where most people give up.**

Not because the food is hard to find, but because:
- They don't want to be "difficult"
- They don't want to explain themselves
- They feel judged
- They think one meal will ruin everything

**Let's fix this.**

## Restaurants: Your Survival Guide

### The Best Restaurant Types (Revisited)

<CardGroup cols={2}>

  </Card>

  <Card title="Italian" icon="pizza-slice" color="#07C983">
    **Why:** Olive oil-based (when authentic)
    **Order:** Pasta with olive oil-based sauce, avoid fried

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### What to Say When Ordering

You don't need to lecture. Just request what you need.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Simple Request">
    **To the server:**
    "Can you cook this in butter instead of vegetable oil?"

    **Most places will say yes.**

    If they can't, order something that doesn't need oil (grilled, baked, steamed).
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Allergy Angle (if needed)">
    **To the server:**
    "I have a sensitivity to seed oils and vegetable oils. Can you make sure my food is cooked in butter or olive oil?"

    Restaurants take allergies seriously. They'll accommodate.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Call Ahead">
    **Before going:**
    "Hi, I have dietary restrictions and can only eat butter or olive oil, not vegetable oils. Do you cook with butter or vegetable oils?"

    This saves embarrassment and lets you plan.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Keep It Short">
    **Don't:**
    "I'm avoiding PUFAs because of oxidative damage to mitochondrial function and I've been doing this biohacking protocol..."

    **Do:**
    "I don't do well with vegetable oils. Can I get butter instead?"

    Short. Simple. No lecture.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### The Safest Orders at Any Restaurant

Even at questionable places, you can usually find something safe:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Grilled or Baked Meat/Fish">
    Ask for no oil, or butter only.

    Examples: Grilled chicken, baked salmon, steak
  </Step>

  <Step title="Plain Baked Potato or Rice">
    Hard to mess up. Add your own butter if possible.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Salad (Dressing on the Side)">
    Bring your own olive oil if needed, or ask for olive oil and vinegar.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Eggs (Breakfast Places)">
    Ask for eggs cooked in butter.

    If they can't, hard-boiled eggs are PUFA-free.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Fast Food (Emergency Only)

Sometimes you're stuck. Here's the least-bad options:

**McDonald's:**
- Egg McMuffin (ask for no margarine, butter if possible)
- Plain hamburger patty, plain fries (ask for no salt if they use seasoning with seed oils)

**Chipotle:**
- Rice, beans, meat (carnitas cooked in own fat), cheese, salsa
- Skip sour cream and guac (often have seed oils added)

**In-N-Out:**
- Burgers protein-style (lettuce wrap)
- Ask if fries are cooked in beef tallow or seed oil (varies by location)

**Rule:** Fast food is not ideal, but don't stress if it's occasionally necessary.

## Family Dinners & Social Judgment

This is harder than restaurants because it's personal.

### The Challenge

People you love will:
- Think you're being difficult
- Say "you used to eat this just fine"
- Pressure you to "just have one bite"
- Get offended if you refuse their food

**This is NOT about the food. It's about control and judgment.**

### What to Say (or Not Say)

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="If They Ask (Casually)">
    **Them:** "Why aren't you eating the [insert dish]?"

    **You:**
    - "I'm not eating that right now, but thank you."
    - "I've been avoiding certain ingredients and feeling much better."
    - "My stomach doesn't do well with that."

    **Don't explain unless they genuinely ask more.**
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="If They Push">
    **Them:** "Come on, just a little bit won't hurt!"

    **You:**
    - "I appreciate it, but I'm good with what I have."
    - "It actually does affect me, so I'm going to pass."
    - "I'd rather not, thanks."

    **Firm but polite. Don't argue.**
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="If They Get Offended">
    **Them:** "I made this for you and you won't even try it?"

    **You:**
    - "I really appreciate the effort, and I'm sorry I can't eat it. This is about my health, not about your cooking."
    - "It looks amazing, but my body doesn't handle [ingredient] well. It's nothing personal."

    **Acknowledge their effort without backing down.**
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="If They Want Details">
    **Them:** "What exactly are you avoiding and why?"

    **You:** (Only if they're genuinely curious)
    - "I've been cutting out seed oils - things like soybean, canola, vegetable oil. Since doing that, my [energy/weight/mood/hormones] have improved a lot."
    - Pause. Let them ask more if interested.

    **Don't preach. Share your experience, not a lecture.**
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Bring Your Own Food

**It's okay to:**
- Bring a side dish (made with safe ingredients)
- Eat beforehand and just have a small plate
- Bring snacks for yourself

**You don't need permission to take care of your health.**

## Travel: Staying On Track

Travel makes everything harder. Here's how to manage.

### Packing Snacks

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Airplane/Road Trip Snacks">
    **Easy to pack:**
    - Cheese (string cheese, Babybel)
    - Dark chocolate (check ingredients)
    - Fruit (apples, oranges, bananas)
    - Hard-boiled eggs (if you have a cooler)
    - Homemade trail mix (no seed oil-coated nuts)
    - Jerky (check ingredients for seed oils)

    **These keep you from being desperate and eating airport food.**
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Hotel Room Staples">
    **If you have a mini-fridge:**
    - Butter
    - Yogurt
    - Cheese
    - Fruit
    - Orange juice
    - Deli meat (check ingredients)

    **Portable:**
    - Instant rice (microwave cups)
    - Honey
    - Salt

    You can make simple meals in your room if needed.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Finding Good Restaurants While Traveling

<Steps>
  <Step title="Research Before You Go">
    Look up steakhouses, Mediterranean, Mexican, or Italian restaurants near your hotel.

    Read menus online. Plan ahead.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Use Google Maps">
    Search "steakhouse near me" or "Mediterranean restaurant near me" when you arrive.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Ask Locals">
    "Where's a good steakhouse or traditional restaurant around here?"

    Locals know better than Yelp.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Worst Case: Grocery Store">
    Buy yogurt, cheese, fruit, rotisserie chicken (check seasoning), pre-cooked rice.

    Not glamorous, but works.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### The Vacation Mindset

<Note>
  **Vacation is temporary.**

  Do your best, but don't stress.

  You WILL eat seed oils occasionally while traveling. That's okay.

  The goal is 80-90% compliance, not perfection.

  Enjoy your trip. Return to your protocol when you're home.
</Note>

## The 90/10 Rule

**Perfection kills progress.**

### What 90/10 Means

**90%:** Home cooking, planned meals, full control
- Zero seed oils
- Follow your protocol
- Track your signals

**10%:** Social situations, travel, life happens
- Do your best
- Make better choices when possible
- Don't stress about unavoidable exposure

### Why This Matters

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Stress Is Worse Than Occasional PUFAs">
    Chronic stress:
    - Raises cortisol
    - Suppresses thyroid
    - Blocks digestion
    - Damages metabolism

    One meal with seed oils:
    - Minor, temporary effect
    - Your body can handle it occasionally

    **Don't trade metabolic healing for anxiety about food.**
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Social Connection Matters">
    Isolating yourself to avoid "bad food" is not healthy.

    - Eat beforehand if needed
    - Bring your own food
    - Order strategically

    But don't skip your best friend's wedding because they're serving seed oils.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Long-Term Sustainability">
    If you can't live your life, you won't stick with this.

    The goal is lifelong metabolic health, not 8-week perfection followed by quitting.

    90/10 is sustainable. 100/0 is not.
