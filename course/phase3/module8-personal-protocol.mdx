title: 'Module 8: Building Your Personal Protocol'
description: 'Create a personalized eating protocol based on your experiment results'
---

**Time to Complete:** 45 minutes

**Priority:** Very Important ⭐⭐

## What You'll Learn

- How to review your experiment results
- Identify what worked for YOUR body
- Design a personal eating protocol (not dogma)
- How to adjust based on changing signals

## The Point of All This

You've been:
- Tracking your body signals
- Eliminating PUFAs
- Running experiments

**Now it's time to synthesize what you've learned into a protocol that works for you.**

<Info>
  This protocol is NOT fixed. It evolves as you learn more about your body.
</Info>

## Review Your Experiment Results

Before building your protocol, look back at what you've tested.

### Questions to Ask

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Which experiments improved my temperature?">
    List experiments where your average daily temp increased.

    **This tells you:** What supports your thyroid and metabolism
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Which experiments gave me better energy?">
    List experiments where energy was stable and sustained (no crashes).

    **This tells you:** What fuels you best
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Which experiments improved digestion?">
    List experiments where you felt comfortable, regular, and satisfied after eating.

    **This tells you:** What your gut tolerates well
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Which experiments made things worse?">
    List experiments that lowered temp, crashed energy, or caused digestive issues.

    **This tells you:** What to avoid or modify
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Which experiments had no effect?">
    List experiments that didn't change anything.

    **This tells you:** These variables don't matter much for you (save mental energy)
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Your Protocol Building Blocks

Based on experiment results, identify your core building blocks.

### Food Categories

For each category, determine what works for YOU:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Fats">
    **Questions:**
    - Do you do better with more or less fat?
    - Which fats make you feel best? (butter, coconut oil, olive oil, ghee)
    - Do you tolerate dairy fats?

    **Example conclusions:**
    - "I do best with 60-80g fat/day, mostly from butter and coconut oil"
    - "I feel better on moderate fat (40-50g), higher carbs"
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Carbs">
    **Questions:**
    - How many carbs do you need daily? (minimum and optimal)
    - Which carb sources work best? (rice, potatoes, fruit, honey)
    - What timing works? (morning, evening, or throughout day)

    **Example conclusions:**
    - "I need 200g+ carbs/day, mostly rice and potatoes"
    - "I do best with carbs at breakfast and dinner, lighter at lunch"
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Protein">
    **Questions:**
    - How much protein do you need? (too little or too much both cause issues)
    - Which protein sources work best? (beef, chicken, fish, eggs, dairy)
    - Do you tolerate eggs? Dairy? Seafood?

    **Example conclusions:**
    - "I need 80-100g protein/day, mostly from beef and eggs"
    - "I feel best on moderate protein (60-80g), can't handle high protein"
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Micronutrients">
    **Questions:**
    - Do you need liver weekly for vitamin A and B vitamins?
    - Do you benefit from bone broth for glycine?
    - Do you need extra salt?
    - Which foods consistently make you feel good?

    **Example conclusions:**
    - "Liver once a week improves my energy dramatically"
    - "I need 1/4 tsp extra salt daily"
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Building Your Protocol

Now assemble your building blocks into a daily structure.

### The Protocol Template

<Steps>
  <Step title="Define Your Non-Negotiables">
    What MUST be in your protocol?

    **Examples:**
    - "No seed oils ever (90%+ compliance)"
    - "Minimum 150g carbs daily"
    - "At least 3 meals per day"
    - "Butter or ghee with every meal"
  </Step>

  <Step title="Define Your Daily Structure">
    What does a typical day look like?

    **Example:**
    - **Morning:** OJ, eggs cooked in butter, sourdough toast with honey
    - **Lunch:** Beef or chicken, rice, vegetables with butter
    - **Dinner:** Salmon or steak, potatoes, salad with olive oil
    - **Snacks:** Fruit, cheese, yogurt with honey
  </Step>

  <Step title="Define Your Flexibility Rules">
    Where can you be flexible without issues?

    **Examples:**
    - "I can skip breakfast if not hungry"
    - "I can eat out 2x/week if I choose carefully"
    - "I can have occasional HFCS if combined with real food"
  </Step>

  <Step title="Define Your Signals to Monitor">
    What will you track to ensure the protocol is working?

    **Examples:**
    - "Morning temp above 97.8°F"
    - "Stable energy (no 3pm crash)"
    - "Sleeping through the night"
    - "Regular digestion (1x/day minimum)"
  </Step>

  <Step title="Define Your Adjustment Triggers">
    What signals mean you need to adjust?

    **Examples:**
    - "If temp drops below 97.5°F for 3+ days, increase carbs"
    - "If energy crashes, add more food or salt"
    - "If digestion gets sluggish, reduce fat or increase fiber"
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Sample Personal Protocols

Here are examples (not prescriptions - build YOUR OWN):

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Example 1: High Carb, Moderate Fat">
    **Non-Negotiables:**

## How to Adjust Your Protocol

Your protocol will evolve. Here's how to make smart adjustments.

### When to Adjust

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Body signals change">
    If temp drops, energy crashes, or digestion worsens for 3+ days, something needs to change.

    **Don't wait weeks. Adjust quickly.**
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Life circumstances change">
    - New job (different stress levels)
    - Increased activity (need more food)
    - Seasonal changes (some people need more carbs in winter)
    - Hormonal changes (pregnancy, menopause, etc.)

    Protocol should adapt to your life.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="You run a new experiment">
    If a new experiment shows better results, incorporate it.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="You hit a plateau">
    If weight or health markers stall for 4+ weeks, try a new experiment or adjust macros.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### How to Adjust

<Steps>
  <Step title="Change ONE Variable at a Time">
    Don't overhaul everything. Change one thing, track for 7 days, assess.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Common Adjustments">
    **If temp is low:** Increase carbs by 50g/day
    **If energy is low:** Increase total calories (more food)
    **If digestion is off:** Reduce fat or increase fiber
    **If sleep is poor:** Add carbs at dinner
    **If hormones are off (women):** Increase carbs and reduce protein
  </Step>

  <Step title="Track the Change">
    Log body signals during the adjustment period.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Assess After 7 Days">
    Did it help, hurt, or do nothing?

    - **Helped:** Keep it
    - **Hurt:** Reverse it
    - **No change:** Try something else
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Your Assignment

<Steps>
  <Step title="Review All Experiment Results">
    Look back at your Experiment Tracker. What worked? What didn't?
  </Step>

  <Step title="Fill Out Personal Protocol Template">
    Use the template to document your protocol based on what you've learned.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test Your Protocol for 14 Days">
    Follow it consistently and track body signals.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Assess and Refine">
    After 14 days, what needs adjusting?
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this module, you should be able to:

✓ Analyze experiment results to identify what works for you
✓ Create a personalized eating protocol
✓ Understand when and how to adjust the protocol
✓ Trust your body's signals over external rules

## The Bottom Line

<Note>
  **Your protocol is YOURS.**

  It's not mine. It's not what worked for someone else. It's what works for YOUR body.

  And it will evolve. That's the point.

  You're building a practice, not following a diet.
