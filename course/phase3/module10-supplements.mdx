title: 'Module 10: Supplements (What Matters, What Doesn't)'
description: 'The short list of supplements worth considering (spoiler: not many)'
---

**Time to Complete:** 30 minutes

**Priority:** Important ⭐

## What You'll Learn

- The supplement trap (don't overdo it)
- What actually helps (the short list)
- When to add supplements
- Warning: supplements aren't the solution

<Warning>
  **Food comes first. Always.**

  Supplements can't fix a bad diet. They're called supplements because they supplement an already solid foundation.
</Warning>

## The Supplement Trap

The supplement industry makes billions by convincing you that:
- You're deficient in everything
- More is better
- Supplements fix problems (they don't)
- You need 20 different bottles

**Truth:** Most supplements are unnecessary if you eat real food and eliminate PUFAs.

### Why People Over-Supplement

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Desperation">
    "I feel terrible, maybe this supplement will fix it."

    **Problem:** You're looking for a pill to solve what requires dietary change.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Marketing">
    "This supplement will boost energy / burn fat / balance hormones!"

    **Problem:** Marketing is not science. Most claims are exaggerated or false.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Influencer Hype">
    "This guru takes 30 supplements and looks great!"

    **Problem:** Correlation ≠ causation. They might look great despite the supplements, not because of them.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Deficiency Fear">
    "What if I'm deficient in [random nutrient]?"

    **Problem:** Actual deficiencies are rare if you eat diverse, nutrient-dense food.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## The Short List (What Actually Matters)

Here are the ONLY supplements worth considering.

### 1. Vitamin D (If You Don't Get Sun)

**Why:**
- Critical for immune function, bone health, mood
- Most people are deficient (especially in winter or if indoors all day)

**Do you need it?**
- If you get 20+ minutes of midday sun on arms/legs daily: No
- If you're indoors most of the time: Yes

**How much:**
- 2000-5000 IU/day (depending on sun exposure)
- Take with fat (it's fat-soluble)

**Best form:**
- Vitamin D3 (not D2)

**Food sources (won't get you enough):**
- Fatty fish, egg yolks, liver

---

### 2. Magnesium (If You're Stressed or Sleep Poorly)

**Why:**
- Supports muscle relaxation, sleep, stress response
- Depleted by stress, caffeine, sugar
- Most people don't get enough from food

**Do you need it?**
- If you sleep well and aren't stressed: No
- If you have muscle cramps, poor sleep, or high stress: Yes

**How much:**
- 300-400mg/day

**Best forms:**
- Magnesium glycinate (for sleep)
- Magnesium citrate (if also constipated)

**Avoid:**
- Magnesium oxide (poorly absorbed)

**Food sources:**
- Dark chocolate, nuts, seeds, leafy greens, bone broth

---

### 3. Vitamin K2 (If You're Taking Vitamin D)

**Why:**
- Works with vitamin D to direct calcium to bones (not arteries)
- Supports heart and bone health

**Do you need it?**
- If you're taking high-dose vitamin D: Yes
- If you eat fermented foods and grass-fed dairy: Probably not

**How much:**
- 100-200mcg/day

**Best form:**
- MK-7 (longer-lasting form)

**Food sources:**
- Natto (fermented soybeans) - richest source
- Grass-fed butter and cheese
- Egg yolks

---

### 4. Liver Capsules (If You Won't Eat Liver)

**Why:**
- Liver is the most nutrient-dense food (vitamin A, B vitamins, iron, copper, zinc)
- Most people hate the taste

**Do you need it?**
- If you eat 4oz liver weekly: No
- If you refuse to eat liver: Yes

**How much:**
- 3000-6000mg/day (follow label)

**Best form:**
- Grass-fed beef liver capsules (freeze-dried)

**Brands:**
- Ancestral Supplements, Vital Proteins

**Food is still better:**
- Just eat liver once a week if you can

---

### 5. Salt (Not Really a Supplement, But Important)

**Why:**
- Most people are under-salted (especially if previously low-carb)
- Salt supports hydration, energy, digestion, blood pressure

**Do you need it?**
- If you salt your food and feel good: No
- If you're tired, lightheaded, or crave salt: Yes

**How much:**
- Add 1/4 to 1/2 tsp sea salt to food or water, 2-3x per day

**Best form:**
- Sea salt or Himalayan pink salt (trace minerals)

**Don't fear salt:**
- Low-salt diets raise cortisol and suppress metabolism
- Salt is essential (unless you have specific medical conditions)

## Maybe (Context-Dependent)

These might help some people, but aren't essential for most.

    **Why:**
    - Supports T4 to T3 conversion (thyroid function)
    - Antioxidant

    **Do you need it?**
    - If you eat 2-3 Brazil nuts daily or seafood 2x/week: No
    - If you eat neither: Maybe

    **How much:**
    - 200mcg/day

    **Food sources:**
    - Brazil nuts (2-3/day = 200mcg)

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Zinc (If Vegetarian or Low-Meat Diet)">

## What You DON'T Need

Let's clear out the clutter.

### Skip These (Unless You Have a Specific Deficiency)

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Multivitamins" icon="x" color="#ef4444">
    Poorly absorbed, imbalanced ratios, unnecessary if eating real food
  </Card>

  <Card title="B-Complex" icon="x" color="#ef4444">
    Get from meat, eggs, liver. Supplements often have synthetic forms.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Vitamin C (for most)" icon="x" color="#ef4444">
    Easy to get from food (citrus, bell peppers, strawberries)
  </Card>

  <Card title="Calcium" icon="x" color="#ef4444">
    Get from dairy, bone-in fish. Supplements can cause issues.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Iron (unless anemic)" icon="x" color="#ef4444">
    Get from red meat, liver. Supplementing without need causes oxidative stress.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Omega-3 (usually)" icon="x" color="#ef4444">
    Better to eat fatty fish. Most fish oil is oxidized (rancid).
  </Card>

  <Card title="Probiotics (most)" icon="x" color="#ef4444">
    Overrated. Fix diet first (PUFAs damage gut more than probiotics help).
  </Card>

  <Card title="Exogenous Ketones" icon="x" color="#ef4444">
    Expensive urine. Your body makes ketones if needed.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Fat Burners" icon="x" color="#ef4444">
    Scams. Usually caffeine + marketing.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Greens Powders" icon="x" color="#ef4444">
    Just eat vegetables. Powders are expensive and oxidized.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## When to Add Supplements

Follow this decision tree:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Are You Eating Real Food?">
    If no: Fix diet first. Supplements can't compensate for processed food.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Have You Eliminated PUFAs?">
    If no: Do that first. PUFAs block nutrient absorption and utilization.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Are You Still Experiencing Specific Issues?">
    - Poor sleep → Try magnesium
    - Low energy + low temp → Check vitamin D, consider liver capsules
    - Always tired despite good diet → Test for actual deficiencies

    **Only add supplements to address specific, persistent issues.**
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test One at a Time">
    Add one supplement, track for 2 weeks, assess if it helped.

    Don't start 5 supplements at once (you won't know what worked).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Reassess Every 3 Months">
    Do you still need it? Has diet improved enough to drop it?

    Goal: Minimal supplementation long-term.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Your Assignment

<Steps>
  <Step title="Assess Your Current Supplements">
    List everything you're currently taking.

    For each one, ask:
    - Why am I taking this?
    - Is it helping? (Track body signals)
    - Can I get this from food instead?
  </Step>

  <Step title="Eliminate Unnecessary Supplements">
    Cut anything that:
    - Isn't addressing a specific issue
    - You can't tell if it's working
    - You're taking "just in case"
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Only What You Actually Need">
    Based on the short list above, add 1-3 supplements max.

    Start with:
    - Vitamin D (if low sun exposure)
    - Magnesium (if sleep or stress issues)
    - Liver capsules (if you won't eat liver)
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this module, you should:

✓ Know which supplements actually matter (very few)
✓ Understand food comes first, always
✓ Avoid the supplement trap (buying 20 bottles)
✓ Make informed decisions about what to take (if anything)

## The Bottom Line

<Note>
  **Supplements are not magic.**

  Food > Supplements, always.

  The best "supplement" is:
  - Eliminating PUFAs
  - Eating real food
  - Getting enough carbs
  - Managing stress
  - Sleeping well

  If you do those things, you'll need very few (if any) supplements.
</Note>
