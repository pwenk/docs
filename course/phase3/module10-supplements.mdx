title: "Module 10: Supplements (What Matters, What Doesn't)"
description: "The short list of supplements worth considering (spoiler: not many)"
---

**Time to Complete:** 30 minutes

**Priority:** Important ⭐

## What You'll Learn

- The supplement trap (don't overdo it)
- What actually helps (the short list)
- When to add supplements
- Warning: supplements aren't the solution

<Warning>
  **Food comes first. Always.**

  Supplements can't fix a bad diet. They're called supplements because they supplement an already solid foundation.
</Warning>

## The Supplement Trap

The supplement industry makes billions by convincing you that:
- You're deficient in everything
- More is better
- Supplements fix problems (they don't)
- You need 20 different bottles

**Truth:** Most supplements are unnecessary if you eat real food and eliminate PUFAs.

### Why People Over-Supplement

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Desperation">
    "I feel terrible, maybe this supplement will fix it."

    **Problem:** You're looking for a pill to solve what requires dietary change.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Marketing">
    "This supplement will boost energy / burn fat / balance hormones!"

    **Problem:** Marketing is not science. Most claims are exaggerated or false.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Influencer Hype">
    "This guru takes 30 supplements and looks great!"

    **Problem:** Correlation ≠ causation. They might look great despite the supplements, not because of them.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Modern Food Quality">
    "What if I'm deficient in [random nutrient]?"

    **Reality:** This concern is actually valid. Modern food contains fewer minerals and nutrients than it did decades ago due to soil depletion, industrial farming, and processing. Strategic supplementation can help fill gaps.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## The Short List (What Actually Matters)

Here are the ONLY supplements worth considering.

### 1. Aspirin (Low-Dose for Metabolic Support)

**Why:**
- Reduces inflammation and stress hormones
- Protects thyroid function
- Improves mitochondrial respiration
- Lowers serotonin (which suppresses metabolism)

**Do you need it?**
- If you're dealing with chronic inflammation, hypothyroid symptoms, or metabolic dysfunction: Yes
- If you have aspirin sensitivity or bleeding disorders: No

**How much:**
- 80-325mg per day (start low)
- Take with food to minimize stomach irritation

**Best combined with:**
- Vitamin K2 (see below) to protect against bleeding and support calcium metabolism

**Important notes:**
- Aspirin should be experimented with, like everything else
- Track body temperature and energy to assess if it helps
- Some people don't tolerate it well - listen to your body

---

### 2. Vitamin D (If You Don't Get Sun)

**Why:**
- Critical for immune function, bone health, mood
- Most people are deficient (especially in winter or if indoors all day)

**Do you need it?**
- If you get 20+ minutes of midday sun on arms/legs daily: No
- If you're indoors most of the time: Yes

**How much:**
- 2000-5000 IU/day (depending on sun exposure)
- Take with fat (it's fat-soluble)

**Best form:**
- Vitamin D3 (not D2)

**Food sources (won't get you enough):**
- Fatty fish, egg yolks, liver

---

### 3. Magnesium (If You're Stressed or Sleep Poorly)

**Why:**
- Supports muscle relaxation, sleep, stress response
- Depleted by stress, caffeine, sugar
- Most people don't get enough from food

**Do you need it?**
- If you sleep well and aren't stressed: No
- If you have muscle cramps, poor sleep, or high stress: Yes

**How much:**
- 300-400mg/day

**Best forms:**
- Magnesium glycinate (for sleep)
- Magnesium citrate (if also constipated)
- **Magnesium oil (topical)** - DIY option: mix magnesium chloride flakes with water, spray on skin. Treat this as an experiment to test absorption and see how your body responds.

**Avoid:**
- Magnesium oxide (poorly absorbed and commonly causes diarrhea)

**Food sources:**
- Dark chocolate, nuts, seeds, leafy greens, bone broth

---

### 4. Vitamin K2 (If You're Taking Vitamin D or Aspirin)

**Why:**
- Works with vitamin D to direct calcium to bones (not arteries)
- Supports heart and bone health
- Protects against bleeding when taking aspirin
- Essential for proper calcium metabolism

**Do you need it?**
- If you're taking high-dose vitamin D: Yes
- If you're taking aspirin: Yes (best to combine)
- If you eat grass-fed dairy regularly: Probably not

**How much:**
- 100-200mcg/day

**Best form:**
- MK-7 (longer-lasting form)

**Best combined with:**
- Aspirin (see above) to support calcium metabolism and protect against bleeding

**Food sources:**
- Grass-fed butter and cheese (best sources)
- Egg yolks from pasture-raised chickens

---

### 5. B-Vitamins (Especially B1 - Thiamine)

**Why:**
- B1 is critical for glucose metabolism and energy production
- B vitamins support thyroid function, nervous system, and stress response
- Many people are deficient, especially if eating refined carbs or drinking alcohol

**Do you need it?**
- If you eat liver, meat, and eggs regularly: Probably not
- If you're tired despite good diet, have brain fog, or consume alcohol: Yes

**How much:**
- B1 (Thiamine): 50-100mg/day
- B-Complex: Follow label (look for active forms)

**Best forms:**
- Thiamine HCl or Benfotiamine (fat-soluble B1)
- Methylated B-complex (better absorbed)

**Important:**
- Test one at a time to see if it helps
- Track energy and mental clarity
- Food sources are always better if you can get them

**Food sources:**
- Liver, pork, beef, eggs, nutritional yeast

---

### 6. Liver Capsules (If You Won't Eat Liver)

**Why:**
- Liver is the most nutrient-dense food (vitamin A, B vitamins, iron, copper, zinc)
- Most people hate the taste

**Do you need it?**
- If you eat 4oz liver weekly: No
- If you refuse to eat liver: Yes

**How much:**
- 3000-6000mg/day (follow label)

**Best form:**
- Grass-fed beef liver capsules (freeze-dried)

**Food is still better:**
- Just eat liver once a week if you can

## Key Minerals: What Ray Peat Emphasized

Before we get to supplements, let's talk about minerals you should prioritize through **food** (not pills).

### Calcium: The Metabolic Protector

**Why it matters:**
- Lowers parathyroid hormone (PTH), which when elevated suppresses thyroid
- Protects against stress hormones
- Supports metabolic rate and bone health

**Best food sources:**
- Dairy (milk, cheese, yogurt) - highest calcium-to-phosphorus ratio
- Bone-in fish (sardines, salmon)
- Eggshell powder (if you can't do dairy)

**How much:**
- Aim for 1-2g daily from food
- Dairy makes this easy (1 cup milk = 300mg, 1oz cheese = 200mg)

**Why not supplements?**
- Food calcium is better absorbed
- Calcium supplements without K2 can deposit in arteries (not bones)

<Info>
**The Calcium-to-Phosphorus Ratio**

Modern diets are high in phosphorus (meat, grains, nuts, soda) and low in calcium. This imbalance raises PTH, which suppresses metabolism.

Solution: Eat more dairy, less processed food. Balance your meat with cheese or milk.
</Info>

### Iron: The Mineral to Watch (or Limit)

**Controversial take:** Most adults don't need more iron—they need less.

**Why iron can be problematic:**
- Excess iron creates oxidative stress (free radicals)
- Stored iron accumulates with age, contributing to disease
- Iron feeds bacteria and pathogens
- Most people aren't actually iron-deficient (unless menstruating heavily)

**Who genuinely needs iron:**
- Women with heavy periods
- Diagnosed anemia (verified by blood test)
- Strict vegetarians (plant iron absorbs poorly)

**How to manage iron:**
- Get iron from food (red meat, liver) - your body regulates absorption better
- **Don't supplement iron unless diagnosed deficient**
- Consider periodic blood donation (removes excess iron)
- **Coffee blocks iron absorption** - drink coffee with iron-rich meals (this is a feature, not a bug)
- **Orange juice INCREASES iron absorption** - in 90% of cases, this is NOT what you want. Avoid OJ with iron-rich meals if you're concerned about iron overload.

<Warning>
**Coffee + Meat = Iron Control**

Ray Peat's tip: Drink coffee with or after meals containing red meat. The polyphenols in coffee bind iron and reduce absorption, preventing excess accumulation.

This is one reason Peat loved coffee—it's protective against iron overload.
</Warning>

### 7. Salt (Not Really a Supplement, But Critical)

**Why:**
- Most people are drastically under-salted (especially if previously low-carb)
- Salt supports hydration, energy, digestion, thyroid function, and healthy blood pressure
- Low-salt diets raise cortisol and suppress metabolism

**Do you need it?**
- Almost everyone needs more salt than they're currently getting
- If you're tired, lightheaded, crave salt, or have low blood pressure: Definitely yes

**How much:**
- Add 1/4 to 1/2 tsp sea salt to food or water, 2-3x per day
- **Err on the side of too much, not too little** - your body will tell you if it's too much (you'll feel thirsty or bloated)
- Most people underestimate their salt needs

**Best form:**
- Plain sea salt (unrefined)
- **AVOID Himalayan pink salt** - contains iron, which most people don't need more of

**Important: Salt and Blood Pressure**

The common belief that salt causes high blood pressure is largely wrong. High blood pressure often stems from **potassium deficiency**, not sodium excess. When you have adequate potassium (from fruit, potatoes, dairy), sodium is well-regulated and beneficial.

**Don't fear salt:**
- Low-salt diets raise cortisol and suppress metabolism
- Salt is essential for cellular function, nerve signaling, and hormone production
- If you have specific medical conditions requiring salt restriction, follow medical advice - but for most people, more salt improves metabolic health

## Maybe (Context-Dependent)

These might help some people, but aren't essential for most.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Selenium (If Not Eating Brazil Nuts or Seafood)">
    **Why:**
    - Supports T4 to T3 conversion (thyroid function)
    - Antioxidant

    **Do you need it?**
    - If you eat 2-3 Brazil nuts daily or seafood 2x/week: No
    - If you eat neither: Maybe

    **How much:**
    - 200mcg/day

    **Food sources:**
    - Brazil nuts (2-3/day = 200mcg)
    - Seafood, eggs, meat
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Zinc (If Vegetarian or Low-Meat Diet)">
    **Why:**
    - Supports immune function, thyroid, testosterone

    **Do you need it?**
    - If you eat red meat regularly: No
    - If you're vegetarian or eat little meat: Maybe

    **How much:**
    - 15-30mg/day

    **Warning:**
    - Too much zinc depletes copper (balance matters)

    **Food sources:**
    - Red meat, oysters, pumpkin seeds
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Vitamin A (Retinol) - If Not Eating Liver">
    **Why:**
    - Supports thyroid receptor sensitivity, skin, immune function

    **Do you need it?**
    - If you eat liver weekly: No
    - If you don't eat liver: Maybe

    **How much:**
    - 10,000-20,000 IU/day

    **Best form:**
    - Cod liver oil (also has vitamin D)
    - Retinyl palmitate

    **Note:**
    - Plant "vitamin A" (beta-carotene) is NOT the same. Your body has to convert it (poorly).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Collagen/Gelatin (MANDATORY - One of the First Things to Add)">
    **Why:**
    - Supports gut lining, skin, joints, sleep (high glycine content)
    - Balances methionine from muscle meat (which can be pro-inflammatory in excess)
    - Critical for metabolic health and tissue repair

    **Do you need it?**
    - YES - This should be one of the first supplements you add
    - If you eat homemade bone broth regularly: You're getting it from food (even better)
    - If you don't: Supplement it

    **How much:**
    - 10-20g/day minimum

    **Best form:**
    - Hydrolyzed collagen powder (dissolves in liquids)
    - Gelatin powder (for cooking, makes things gel)
    - Bone broth is still the best source

    **IMPORTANT WARNING about food sources:**
    - **DO NOT rely on chicken skin or pork rinds** - these are loaded with PUFAs from industrial animal feed
    - Factory-farmed animals are fattened with seed oils and grains, which concentrate PUFAs in their fat
    - If you eat these PUFA-laden animal fats, you'll fatten up too
    - Stick to bone broth from grass-fed/pasture-raised animals or quality collagen supplements

## What You DON'T Need

Let's clear out the clutter.

### Skip These (Unless You Have a Specific Deficiency)

    Easy to get from food (citrus, bell peppers, strawberries)
  </Card>

  <Card title="Calcium Supplements" icon="x" color="#ef4444">
    AVOID - Get calcium from dairy and bone-in fish. Calcium supplements are really bad and can deposit in arteries instead of bones.

## When to Add Supplements

<Info>
**Treat Supplements Like Food Experiments**

All supplements should be experimented with and tested just like the food changes you've been making. Track your body signals (temperature, energy, digestion, mood) before and after adding each supplement.

Remember: **Food comes first, always.** Real food provides nutrients in their natural, bioavailable forms with cofactors your body recognizes. Supplements are exactly that - supplements to an already solid foundation, not replacements for poor diet.
</Info>

Follow this decision tree:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Are You Eating Real Food?">
    If no: Fix diet first. Supplements can't compensate for processed food.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Have You Eliminated PUFAs?">
    If no: Do that first. PUFAs block nutrient absorption and utilization.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Are You Still Experiencing Specific Issues?">
    - Poor sleep → Try magnesium
    - Low energy + low temp → Check vitamin D, consider liver capsules
    - Always tired despite good diet → Test for actual deficiencies

    **Only add supplements to address specific, persistent issues.**
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test One at a Time">
    Add one supplement, track for 2 weeks, assess if it helped.

    Don't start 5 supplements at once (you won't know what worked).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Reassess Every 3 Months">
    Do you still need it? Has diet improved enough to drop it?

    Goal: Minimal supplementation long-term.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Your Assignment

<Steps>
  <Step title="Assess Your Current Supplements">
    List everything you're currently taking.

    For each one, ask:
    - Why am I taking this?
    - Is it helping? (Track body signals)
    - Can I get this from food instead?
  </Step>

  <Step title="Eliminate Unnecessary Supplements">
    Cut anything that:
    - Isn't addressing a specific issue
    - You can't tell if it's working
    - You're taking "just in case"
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Only What You Actually Need">
    Based on the short list above, add 1-3 supplements max.

    Start with:
    - Vitamin D (if low sun exposure)
    - Magnesium (if sleep or stress issues)
    - Liver capsules (if you won't eat liver)
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this module, you should:

✓ Know which supplements actually matter (very few)
✓ Understand food comes first, always
✓ Avoid the supplement trap (buying 20 bottles)
✓ Make informed decisions about what to take (if anything)

## The Bottom Line

<Note>
  **Supplements are not magic, sugar.**

  Food > Supplements, always.

  The best "supplement" is:
  - Eliminating PUFAs
  - Eating real food
  - Getting enough carbs
  - Managing stress
  - Sleeping well

  If you do those things, you'll need very few (if any) supplements.
