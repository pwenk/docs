title: "Module 13: Don't Be a Zealot - The Anti-Dogma Principle"
description: "Ray Peat's core philosophy: Think for yourself, trust your body, reject rigid rules"
---

**Time to Complete:** 15 minutes

**Priority:** Very Important ⭐⭐⭐

## What You'll Learn

This module brings you back to the foundation of everything:
- Why Ray Peat would hate "Peatarianism" as a cult
- Why stress kills metabolism faster than seed oils
- How perfectionism sabotages your results
- Why your body is the only authority that matters
- The anti-dogma principle that makes this sustainable

## The Irony Nobody Talks About

Ray Peat spent his career warning people not to blindly trust authorities—including him.

Yet what happened? His followers turned his ideas into another religion.

**The "Peat Police" checklist:**
- ❌ Zero PUFA tolerance (not even one almond)
- ❌ Only milk and orange juice (no other foods allowed)
- ❌ Obsessive temperature checking (every hour)
- ❌ Guilt and anxiety over every meal
- ❌ Treating Peat's writings like scripture

This is the **opposite** of what Ray Peat intended.

<Warning>
**The Perfectionism Paradox**

When you stress about eating "perfectly," you raise cortisol, suppress your thyroid, and damage your metabolism MORE than the occasional seed oil or skipped carrot ever could.

Stress is the number one killer. Not PUFAs. Not sugar. Not starch. **Stress.**
</Warning>

## What Ray Peat Actually Said

Let's look at what Peat's philosophy **really** is:

<CodeGroup>

```text What People Think Peat Said
"Follow these rules perfectly"
"Never eat these foods"
"You must drink milk and OJ"
"Supplements are mandatory"
"Track everything obsessively"
```

```text What Peat Actually Said
"Think for yourself"
"Listen to your body's feedback"
"Find what works for YOU"
"Food > supplements"
"Trust your experience over studies"
```

</CodeGroup>

Ray Peat's entire message: **Base your views on what is experientially true for you, not on dogma.**

## The Anti-Dogma Principles

### 1. Your Body Is the Authority

Not me. Not Ray Peat. Not any expert with credentials.

**Your body's signals > anyone's advice**

If you feel amazing eating white rice with butter, keep doing it—even if someone online says "Peat said sugar is better than starch."

If milk gives you terrible digestion, don't force it down because "calcium is essential." Find other sources.

If you genuinely crave nuts occasionally, your body might be telling you something. Don't ignore it because of PUFA dogma.

### 2. Stress Damages More Than Food

The research is clear: **chronic stress suppresses thyroid function more than occasional PUFA consumption.**

What causes stress?
- Obsessing over food purity
- Feeling guilty about meals
- Anxiously tracking every metric
- Restricting foods you love
- Living in constant fear of "bad" foods

<Info>
**The Stress-Metabolism Connection**

When you're stressed about food:
- Cortisol stays elevated
- Thyroid function drops
- Metabolism slows
- Body temperature falls
- You feel worse despite "eating perfectly"

Meanwhile, someone who eats 90% right but enjoys life without anxiety will have BETTER metabolic health.
</Info>

### 3. The 90/10 Rule (Not 100/0)

You learned this in Module 12, but it bears repeating:

**Aiming for 90% adherence with 10% flexibility is MORE effective than 100% rigid perfection.**

Why?
- Sustainability: You can maintain 90/10 for life
- Stress reduction: No guilt over occasional "slips"
- Social connection: You can eat with friends and family
- Mental health: Food doesn't control your life

The person who eats PUFA-free for 2 months then burns out and quits has worse results than someone who maintains 90% for years.

### 4. Progress > Perfection

You don't need to:
- ✗ Eliminate ALL starch forever
- ✗ Drink milk if you hate it
- ✗ Take supplements you can't afford
- ✗ Eat liver if it makes you gag
- ✗ Avoid restaurants forever
- ✗ Track every meal obsessively

You DO need to:
- ✓ Reduce major PUFA sources (seed oils, processed foods)
- ✓ Eat enough carbs for YOUR body (sugar, starch, or both)
- ✓ Get adequate protein from sources you enjoy
- ✓ Listen to your body's temperature, energy, mood
- ✓ Adjust based on YOUR feedback, not someone else's rules

## The Cult Warning Signs

Watch out for these signs you've turned this into dogma:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Sign 1: Food Anxiety">
    You feel anxious or guilty about food choices. You obsess over ingredients. Eating out causes panic.

    **Reality check:** If the protocol causes MORE stress than the original problem, you're doing it wrong.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Sign 2: Black-and-White Thinking">
    Foods are either "good" or "evil." No middle ground. You can't have a flexible approach.

    **Reality check:** Even Ray Peat acknowledged that context matters. A food isn't universally good or bad—it depends on the person, timing, and overall diet.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Sign 3: Ignoring Your Body">
    You follow rules even when your body says "this isn't working." You dismiss negative feedback as "detox" or "healing crisis."

    **Reality check:** Your body doesn't lie. If you feel worse after months of following advice, the advice is wrong FOR YOU.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Sign 4: Evangelizing Aggressively">
    You can't stop talking about Peat. You judge others' food choices. You need everyone to "see the truth."

    **Reality check:** You're not enlightened—you've joined a cult. Peat would be horrified.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Sign 5: Supplement Obsession">
    You're taking 15+ supplements because some forum said to. You spend hundreds monthly on pills.

    **Reality check:** Peat said FOOD FIRST. Supplements are adjuncts, not replacements. If your diet needs 15 supplements to "work," the diet is broken.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## What About the Science?

Here's Ray Peat's stance on credentials and studies:

<Info>
**Credentials Mean Nothing**

MD. PhD. "Evidence-based." These are just words people hide behind when their arguments can't stand on their own.

You know who figured out important things about nutrition? An engineer. A computer scientist. People with zero letters after their names who just looked at the data without the bias of a broken system.

Trust arguments that stand on their own merit. Trust your own direct experiments (n=1 is more valuable than n=1,000 when it's YOUR body). Trust people whose results speak louder than their titles.
</Info>

This means:
- Question what you read (including this course)
- Test everything on yourself
- Trust your experience over any study
- Don't defer to authority blindly

## The Real Ray Peat Philosophy

If you take away one thing from this entire course, let it be this:

**Peat's genius wasn't giving you a diet plan. It was giving you permission to think for yourself.**

His ideas:
- Challenge mainstream dogma (good)
- Provide alternative frameworks (good)
- Encourage experimentation (good)
- Make you question authority (good)

But they're not:
- Absolute truth
- Rules to follow blindly
- A replacement religion
- The only path to health

<Note>
**What Peat Would Say**

If Ray Peat saw people obsessively avoiding all starch, refusing to eat anywhere but home, taking 20 supplements, and anxiously tracking every metric...

He'd probably say: "You missed the point entirely. Go enjoy your life."
</Note>

## How to Apply This

### Week-by-Week Flexibility

Instead of rigid rules, ask yourself:

**Week 1-4: Foundation**
- "Am I reducing major PUFA sources?" (seed oils, processed foods)
- "Am I eating enough carbs and protein?"
- "Do I feel warmer and more energetic?"

If yes → continue. If no → adjust.

**Month 2-3: Experimentation**
- "What experiments am I running this month?"
- "What does my body prefer—sugar or starch? Milk or no milk?"
- "Am I tracking body signals, not just following rules?"

**Month 4+: Personalization**
- "Have I found MY version of this approach?"
- "Can I maintain this without stress?"
- "Am I 90% consistent, 10% flexible?"

### When to Break "The Rules"

It's OKAY to:
- Eat white rice or potatoes (even if "sugar is better")
- Skip the daily carrot salad (if you hate it)
- Have restaurant meals occasionally (yes, with seed oils)
- Take a break from tracking (if it's stressing you)
- Ignore a supplement someone swears by (if it doesn't work for you)

**The only non-negotiable: Listen to your body.**

## The Bottom Line

This course gave you tools:
- PUFA awareness
- Strategic glucose intake
- Body signal tracking
- Experimentation framework

But YOU decide:
- How strictly to follow them
- Which parts work for your life
- When to adjust or break the rules
- What "success" looks like for you

<Warning>
**Final Warning: Don't Replace One Cult With Another**

If you came here from:
- Veganism → Don't become a dairy zealot
- Keto → Don't become a sugar zealot
- Carnivore → Don't become an anti-meat zealot

Just... be a person who eats food and feels good.
</Warning>

## Your Assignment

No worksheet this time. Just a reflection:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Identify Your Dogma Risk">
    Where are you most likely to become rigid or obsessive? Food purity? Supplement stacking? Metric tracking?

    Write it down. Awareness prevents the slide into zealotry.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set Your 10% Flex Zone">
    What will your 10% flexibility look like?

    - Friday dinners out with friends?
    - Occasional treats you love?
    - Foods that "break rules" but feel good?

    Define it now so you don't feel guilty later.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Write Your Anti-Dogma Reminder">
    Create a note in your phone:

    "My body is the authority. If I feel worse following advice, the advice is wrong for me. Progress > perfection. 90/10 for life."

    Read it whenever you feel stressed about food.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Learning Outcomes
