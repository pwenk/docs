This course is built on a simple principle: **experimentation over dogma**. You'll learn by doing, tracking your body's signals, and building a personalized protocol that works for YOU.

In 12 modules, you'll discover why conventional nutrition advice has failed, learn to read your body's signals, eliminate metabolic disruptors, and build a sustainable eating protocol based on what YOUR body tells you—not what experts claim.

## Course Philosophy

This isn't a diet. It's a **practice** - a way of developing awareness and trust in your own body.

### What Makes This Different

- **No dogma** - You'll question everything, including what we teach
- **Experimentation first** - Learn by testing, not by believing
- **Your body decides** - Not experts, not studies, not gurus
- **Sustainable** - Built for life, not 30-day transformations
