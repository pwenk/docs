description: 'Your 12 modules architected for transforming health through experimentation'
---

This course is built on a simple principle: **experimentation over dogma**. You'll learn by doing, tracking your body's signals, and building a personalized protocol that works for YOU.

Over 8 weeks and 12 modules, you'll discover why conventional nutrition advice has failed, learn to read your body's signals, eliminate metabolic disruptors, and build a sustainable eating protocol based on what YOUR body tells you—not what experts claim.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

- **Track metabolic signals** - Monitor body temperature, pulse, energy levels, and mood patterns to understand what your body is telling you
- **Identify hidden PUFAs** - Recognize seed oils and polyunsaturated fats in everyday foods, restaurants, and processed products
- **Design personal experiments** - Create and run structured n=1 experiments to test how different foods and practices affect YOUR metabolism
- **Build a sustainable protocol** - Develop a personalized eating approach that fits your life, social situations, and long-term goals
- **Question nutrition dogma** - Critically evaluate mainstream advice and trust your body's feedback over expert opinions
- **Navigate real-world challenges** - Handle restaurants, travel, social events, and family gatherings while maintaining your protocol

## Course Philosophy

This isn't a diet. It's a **practice** - a way of developing awareness and trust in your own body.

### What Makes This Different

- **No dogma** - You'll question everything, including what we teach
- **Experimentation first** - Learn by testing, not by believing
- **Your body decides** - Not experts, not studies, not gurus
- **Sustainable** - Built for life, not 30-day transformations

## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Do I need any prior nutrition knowledge?">
    No! This course assumes you're starting fresh. We'll teach you everything you need to know, and we encourage you to question what you think you already know. The course is designed for beginners and experienced health enthusiasts alike.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I do this course if I have dietary restrictions (vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, etc.)?">
    **Vegetarian:** Yes, though it's more challenging. You'll need to find protein sources without PUFAs and ensure adequate nutrients (vitamin A, B12, zinc).

    **Vegan:** This will be very difficult, as many plant proteins and fats are high in PUFAs. However, you can still learn the principles and adapt where possible.

    **Gluten-free:** Absolutely! Many course recommendations are naturally gluten-free (rice, potatoes, meat, dairy).

    **Allergies:** The experiment approach helps you identify YOUR tolerances. Adapt as needed.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is this safe if I have a medical condition (diabetes, thyroid issues, heart disease)?">
    This course focuses on eliminating processed seed oils and eating real food, which generally supports metabolic health. However:

    - **Always consult your doctor** before making dietary changes
    - This is **not medical advice**—it's education
    - If you're on medication, work with your healthcare provider to monitor changes

    Many people with metabolic conditions see improvements, but individual results vary.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Will I lose weight on this course?">
    Maybe. Weight loss is NOT the primary goal—metabolic health is.

    **What typically happens:**
    - Some people lose weight as metabolism heals
    - Some gain weight initially (if undereating before)
    - Some recompose (lose fat, gain muscle)
    - Weight normalizes over 3-6 months

    Focus on temperature, energy, and how you feel—not the scale.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="I've tried keto/paleo/carnivore. How is this different?">
    **Key differences:**
    - We don't eliminate food groups dogmatically
    - We embrace strategic carbs (glucose is essential)
    - We focus on PUFA elimination over macros
    - We emphasize experimentation, not rigid rules
    - We track body signals, not calories

    If you've damaged your metabolism with low-carb, this course teaches how to heal it.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do I have to eliminate seed oils 100%?">
    **At home:** Yes, aim for 100% elimination.

    **When eating out:** Do your best (aim for 80-90%).

    **The 90/10 rule:** 90% compliance gives you 90% of the benefits. Perfection is not required and creates stress, which damages metabolism more than occasional PUFA exposure.

    Start with eliminating them from your kitchen, then work on social situations.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How much does this cost beyond the course itself?">
    **Ongoing costs:**
    - Real food (butter, meat, produce) costs more than processed food—budget $50-100/week extra depending on current diet
    - Digital thermometer: $10-15 (one-time)
    - Optional supplements (vitamin D, magnesium): $20-30/month if needed

    **No expensive biohacking required.** This is about food quality, not gadgets.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What if I don't see results after 8 weeks?">
    **Common reasons for slow results:**
    - Still consuming hidden PUFAs (check labels obsessively)
    - Not eating enough (undereating suppresses metabolism)
    - Not eating enough carbs (thyroid needs glucose)
    - High stress (cortisol blocks everything)
    - Severe metabolic damage (may take 3-6 months)

    The course teaches you how to troubleshoot using body signals and experiments.
