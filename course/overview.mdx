description: 'Your 12 modules architected for transforming health through experimentation'
---

This course is built on a simple principle: **experimentation over dogma**. You'll learn by doing, tracking your body's signals, and building a personalized protocol that works for YOU.

In 12 modules, you'll discover why conventional nutrition advice has failed, learn to read your body's signals, eliminate metabolic disruptors, and build a sustainable eating protocol based on what YOUR body tells you—not what experts claim.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

- **Track metabolic signals** - Monitor body temperature, pulse, energy levels, and mood patterns to understand what your body is telling you
- **Identify hidden PUFAs** - Recognize seed oils and polyunsaturated fats in everyday foods, restaurants, and processed products
- **Design personal experiments** - Create and run structured n=1 experiments to test how different foods and practices affect YOUR metabolism
- **Build a sustainable protocol** - Develop a personalized eating approach that fits your life, social situations, and long-term goals
- **Question nutrition dogma** - Critically evaluate mainstream advice and trust your body's feedback over expert opinions
- **Navigate real-world challenges** - Handle restaurants, travel, social events, and family gatherings while maintaining your protocol

### Getting Support

## Course Philosophy

This isn't a diet. It's a **practice** - a way of developing awareness and trust in your own body.

### What Makes This Different

- **No dogma** - You'll question everything, including what we teach
- **Experimentation first** - Learn by testing, not by believing
- **Your body decides** - Not experts, not studies, not gurus
- **Sustainable** - Built for life, not 30-day transformations

## The Ray Peat Foundation

These principles are built on the work of **Ray Peat, PhD**, a pioneering biologist whose metabolic research challenged decades of mainstream nutrition dogma.

Peat's core insight was simple but radical: **most people don't try to understand their own body.** Instead, they follow external rules, trust flawed studies, and ignore what their body is telling them.

### Peat's Philosophy

Your body is constantly communicating through signals:
- Body temperature (metabolic rate)
- Energy levels (fuel availability)
- Mood and mental clarity (hormone balance)
- Digestion (nutrient absorption)

**The practice:** Listen to these signals, experiment systematically, and build a protocol based on what YOUR body responds to—not what worked in a population study.

This course translates Peat's bioenergetic principles into a practical, systematic framework you can follow.

## Why This Matters: What Students Experience

When you heal your metabolism through PUFA elimination, adequate glucose, and body signal awareness, profound changes happen—often within weeks:

### Physical Transformation

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Metabolic Markers" icon="temperature-high">
    - **Higher body temperature** (97.0°F → 98.2°F+)
    - **Stable energy** (no afternoon crashes)
    - **Better sleep** (deeper, more restorative)
    - **Healthy weight** (naturally finds optimal range)
  </Card>

  <Card title="Hormonal Health" icon="heart-pulse">
    - **Increased testosterone** (men report higher libido, confidence, drive)
    - **Balanced hormones** (women see regular cycles, reduced PMS)
    - **Thyroid optimization** (no more cold hands/feet)
    - **Improved fertility** (for both men and women)
  </Card>

  <Card title="Physical Appearance" icon="sparkles">
    - **Hair regrowth** (thicker, fuller hair—many report regrowth in thinning areas)
    - **Glowing skin** (clearer complexion, reduced inflammation)
    - **Stronger nails** (less brittle, faster growth)
    - **Leaner body composition** (muscle gain, fat loss)
  </Card>

  <Card title="Mental Clarity" icon="brain">
    - **Sharper focus** (no more brain fog)
    - **Better mood** (stable, optimistic outlook)
    - **Improved memory** (cognitive function)
    - **Reduced anxiety** (calm nervous system)
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Why These Changes Happen

**High metabolism = High thyroid function = High sex hormones = High vitality**

When you eliminate PUFAs (which damage mitochondria) and provide adequate glucose (which thyroid needs), your body can:
- Produce optimal levels of T3 (active thyroid hormone)
- Synthesize testosterone and progesterone properly
- Maintain healthy body temperature
- Support hair follicles, skin cells, and tissue regeneration

**This isn't biohacking. It's removing the blocks so your body can do what it's designed to do.**

### Real-World Benefits

Students use these improvements for:
- **Career confidence** (mental clarity and energy for high performance)
- **Relationship vitality** (libido and physical attraction)
- **Athletic performance** (better recovery, strength gains)
- **Aging gracefully** (maintaining vitality in 40s, 50s, 60s+)

<Note>
**The Bottom Line**

This course isn't just about "feeling better." It's about reclaiming your biological vitality—testosterone, libido, energy, mental sharpness, physical attractiveness—through metabolic optimization.

When metabolism works, everything works.
