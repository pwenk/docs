description: 'Document your current state and understand how nutrition science got hijacked'
---

**Time to Complete:** 30 minutes

**Priority:** Very Important ⭐⭐

## What You'll Learn

This module helps you:
- Document your current eating habits (no judgment, just data)
- Understand why scientists and experts are wrong
- See the sugar/obesity chart revelation
- Shift from "I know" to "I'm experimenting"

## The Problem: You Already "Know"

The biggest obstacle to learning is what you already think you know.

You've been told:
- Fat (especially saturated fat) causes heart disease
- Sugar makes you fat
- Calories in, calories out
- Eat less, move more

**What if all of that is wrong?**

## The Sugar/Obesity Chart That Changes Everything

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/sugar-obesity-chart.svg" alt="Sugar consumption vs obesity rates showing inverse correlation from 1980-2013" />
</Frame>

Look at what happened from 1980-2013:
- **Sugar consumption:** DECREASED by 15-23% (especially after 1999)
- **Obesity rates:** CONTINUED TO RISE dramatically

If sugar causes obesity, how do we explain this?

<Info>
**Data Source:** US Department of Agriculture food availability data. Sugar data includes all added sugars (table sugar, honey, high-fructose corn syrup) but not sugars naturally occurring in fruits and vegetables.

**Analysis:** Dr. Stephan Guyenet, [References for debate with Gary Taubes](https://www.stephanguyenet.com/references-for-my-debate-with-gary-taubes-on-the-joe-rogan-experience/)

**Key Finding:** After 1999, sweetened beverage consumption declined substantially, yet obesity rates kept climbing. This demonstrates that sugar consumption alone cannot explain the obesity epidemic.
</Info>

### What Actually Changed?

One thing: **Seed oil consumption increased 1000%**

In 1970, the American Heart Association told everyone to stop eating saturated fat (butter, lard, coconut oil) and switch to "heart-healthy" vegetable oils (soybean, canola, corn oil).

That's when the obesity epidemic started.

## Your First Task: Take Stock

Before you change anything, you need to know where you are.

### Food & Feeling Journal

For the next **3 days**, track:

<Steps>
  <Step title="What You Eat">
    Write down everything you eat and drink. Don't change your habits - just observe.
  </Step>

  <Step title="When You Eat">
    Note the time of each meal or snack.
  </Step>

  <Step title="How You Feel">
    Track your energy, mood, and digestion after eating:
    - Energy: 1-10 scale
    - Mood: Stable, anxious, irritable, calm
    - Digestion: Bloated, comfortable, gassy, satisfied
  </Step>

  <Step title="Body Signals">
    Note any patterns:
    - Temperature (do you feel cold?)
    - Sleep quality
    - Mental clarity
    - Physical energy
  </Step>
</Steps>

## The Mindset Shift

This course requires you to do something difficult: **question what you know**.

### From "I Know" to "I'm Experimenting"

<CodeGroup>

```text Old Mindset
"I know sugar is bad for me"
"I know I need to eat less"
"I know experts are right"
"I know what works"
```

```text New Mindset
"What if I'm wrong about sugar?"
"What if my body needs more food?"
"What if experts got it backwards?"
"What if I test it myself?"
```

</CodeGroup>

This is hard. Your ego doesn't want to admit it might be wrong. But that resistance is exactly what's keeping you stuck.

## Why You Can't Trust "The Science"

Here's what nobody tells you: credentials mean nothing.

MD. PhD. "Evidence-based." These are just words people hide behind when their arguments can't stand on their own.

You know who figured out important things about nutrition? An engineer. A computer scientist. People with zero letters after their names who just looked at the data without the bias of a broken system.

### How Modern Science Actually Works

Most nutrition science is garbage. Not because scientists are evil—because the system is designed to produce garbage:

**The Academic Treadmill:**
- PhD students spend 5-7 years running experiments
- Most of it is just repeating what someone else already did
- The "new" findings are usually just statistical noise
- Everyone knows it's broken, but nobody can say it out loud

**The Groupthink Problem:**
- Funding goes to researchers who support the current narrative
- Question saturated fat = lose your grant money
- Suggest sugar isn't the villain = career suicide
- The "scientific consensus" is just a bunch of scared people protecting their jobs

**The Meta-Analysis Scam:**
- "Hierarchy of evidence" puts meta-analyses at the top
- Meta-analyses = averaging together a bunch of mediocre studies
- Your personal results (n=1) are dismissed as "anecdotal"
- Except YOUR BODY is the only one that matters for YOU

### The 1960s-Present Disaster

1. **1960s:** Ancel Keys cherry-picks data (ignores 16 countries that don't fit his fat-causes-heart-disease theory)
2. **1970s:** American Heart Association says "eat seed oils, not butter"
3. **1980s-present:** Obesity epidemic explodes while scientists double down on the same failed advice

Admitting they were wrong would mean losing credibility, funding, and careers.

So they don't.

### What Actually Works

Forget credentials. Forget "evidence-based" (which usually means "we have no idea but this sounds scientific").

**Trust:**
- Arguments that stand on their own merit
- Your own direct experiments (n=1 is more valuable than n=1000 when it's YOUR body)
- People whose results speak louder than their titles
- Body signals over studies

This course is about making you the authority on your own metabolism.

    **Option 3: Use a Tracking App**
    - [Cronometer](https://cronometer.com/) (tracks macros + micronutrients) - [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/cronometer-nutrition-tracker/id1145935738) | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cronometer.android.gold)
    - [MyFitnessPal](https://www.myfitnesspal.com/) (simpler, food-focused) - [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/app/myfitnesspal/id341232718) | [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.myfitnesspal.android)

    <Warning>
    **Set 1-3 Daily Reminders**

    The most important part is asking yourself **"How do I feel?"** after eating. Set phone reminders for:
    - After breakfast (9am)
    - After lunch (2pm)
    - After dinner (8pm)

    The data only matters if you actually write it down.
    </Warning>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="2. 'Everything I Thought I Knew' Worksheet">
    Write down every nutrition "fact" you believe. We'll test these throughout the course with actual evidence.

    **Option 1: Download PDF**
    - [Everything I Thought I Knew Worksheet (PDF)](/resources/worksheets/everything-i-thought-i-knew-worksheet.pdf)
    - Includes columns for: Belief → Where I Learned It → Evidence For/Against

    **Option 2: Use Your Notes App**
    Copy this into your Notes app:

    ```
    BELIEFS I'M TESTING

    Belief: Sugar makes you fat
    Where I learned it:
    Evidence FOR this belief:
    Evidence AGAINST this belief:

    Belief: Saturated fat clogs arteries
    Where I learned it:
    Evidence FOR this belief:
    Evidence AGAINST this belief:

    Belief: I need to eat less to lose weight
    Where I learned it:
    Evidence FOR this belief:
    Evidence AGAINST this belief:

    Belief: Calories in, calories out
    Where I learned it:
    Evidence FOR this belief:
    Evidence AGAINST this belief:

    [Add more beliefs...]
    ```

    <Info>
    **The "Evidence" Column Is Key**

    As you go through the course, you'll fill in evidence for AND against each belief. This isn't about being right or wrong—it's about testing your assumptions.

    Most of what you "know" came from:
    - Your doctor (who learned it in medical school 20 years ago)
    - Media headlines (funded by food companies)
    - Diet books (selling a narrative)
    - Cultural groupthink (everyone "knows" fat is bad)

    By the end of this course, you'll have actual evidence to evaluate each belief.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this module, you should be able to:

✓ Complete a 3-day food and feeling journal
✓ Understand how nutrition science was corrupted
✓ Shift from "I know" to "I'm experimenting"
✓ Question expert advice (including ours)

## What's Next?

In **Module 2**, you'll learn about the real enemy: PUFAs (polyunsaturated fatty acids). These seed oils are in everything, and they're destroying your metabolism at the cellular level.
