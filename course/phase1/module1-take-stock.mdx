**Time to Complete:** 30 minutes

**Priority:** Very Important ⭐⭐

## What You'll Learn

This module helps you:
- Document your current eating habits (no judgment, just data)
- Understand why scientists and experts are wrong
- See the sugar/obesity chart revelation
- Shift from "I know" to "I'm experimenting"

## The Problem: You Already "Know"

The biggest obstacle to learning is what you already think you know.

You've been told:
- Fat (especially saturated fat) causes heart disease
- Sugar makes you fat
- Calories in, calories out
- Eat less, move more

**What if all of that is wrong?**

## The Sugar/Obesity Chart That Changes Everything

<Frame>

</Frame>

Look at what happened from 1970-2020:
- **Sugar consumption:** DECREASED
- **Obesity rates:** SKYROCKETED

If sugar causes obesity, how do we explain this?

### What Actually Changed?

One thing: **Seed oil consumption increased 1000%**

In 1970, the American Heart Association told everyone to stop eating saturated fat (butter, lard, coconut oil) and switch to "heart-healthy" vegetable oils (soybean, canola, corn oil).

That's when the obesity epidemic started.

## Your First Task: Take Stock

Before you change anything, you need to know where you are.

### Food & Feeling Journal

For the next **3 days**, track:

<Steps>
  <Step title="What You Eat">
    Write down everything you eat and drink. Don't change your habits - just observe.
  </Step>

  <Step title="When You Eat">
    Note the time of each meal or snack.
  </Step>

  <Step title="How You Feel">
    Track your energy, mood, and digestion after eating:
    - Energy: 1-10 scale
    - Mood: Stable, anxious, irritable, calm
    - Digestion: Bloated, comfortable, gassy, satisfied
  </Step>

  <Step title="Body Signals">
    Note any patterns:
    - Temperature (do you feel cold?)
    - Sleep quality
    - Mental clarity
    - Physical energy
  </Step>
</Steps>

## The Mindset Shift

This course requires you to do something difficult: **question what you know**.

### From "I Know" to "I'm Experimenting"

<CodeGroup>

```text Old Mindset
"I know sugar is bad for me"
"I know I need to eat less"
"I know experts are right"
"I know what works"
```

```text New Mindset
"What if I'm wrong about sugar?"
"What if my body needs more food?"
"What if experts got it backwards?"
"What if I test it myself?"
```

</CodeGroup>

This is hard. Your ego doesn't want to admit it might be wrong. But that resistance is exactly what's keeping you stuck.

## Why Experts Are Wrong

It's not a conspiracy. It's how science works (and fails):

### The Process That Broke Nutrition Science

1. **1960s:** Ancel Keys publishes the "Seven Countries Study"
   - Cherry-picked data to show fat causes heart disease
   - Ignored countries that didn't fit his hypothesis

2. **1970s:** American Heart Association endorses low-fat diet
   - Tells everyone to eat seed oils instead of saturated fat
   - Food industry responds with low-fat, high-carb processed foods

3. **1980s-present:** Obesity epidemic explodes
   - Scientists double down on the same advice
   - Anyone questioning it gets attacked
   - Funding goes to researchers who support the narrative

### The Result?

50 years of failed advice that made people sicker.

But admitting they were wrong would mean:
- Losing credibility
- Losing funding
- Losing careers

So they keep repeating the same broken advice.

## Your Assignment

Complete these three tasks:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="1. Food & Feeling Journal (3 days)">
    Download the template and track everything for 3 days. No changes to your diet yet - just observation.

    **Download:** [Food & Feeling Journal Template](#)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="2. 'Everything I Thought I Knew' Worksheet">
    Write down every nutrition "fact" you believe. We'll test these throughout the course.

    Examples:
    - "Sugar makes you fat"
    - "Saturated fat clogs arteries"
    - "I need to eat less to lose weight"

    **Download:** [Everything I Thought I Knew Worksheet](#)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="3. Watch: The Science Is Wrong (10 min)">
    A quick presentation on how nutrition science got hijacked.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this module, you should be able to:

✓ Complete a 3-day food and feeling journal
✓ Understand how nutrition science was corrupted
✓ Shift from "I know" to "I'm experimenting"
✓ Question expert advice (including ours)

## What's Next?

In **Module 2**, you'll learn about the real enemy: PUFAs (polyunsaturated fatty acids). These seed oils are in everything, and they're destroying your metabolism at the cellular level.
