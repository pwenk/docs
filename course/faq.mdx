## Getting Started

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Do I need any prior nutrition knowledge?">
    No! This course assumes you're starting fresh. We'll teach you everything you need to know, and we encourage you to question what you think you already know. The course is designed for beginners and experienced health enthusiasts alike.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What do I need to get started?">
    **Required:**
    - Digital oral thermometer ($10-15)
    - Notebook or digital tracker for body signals
    - Commitment to 5-10 minutes daily tracking

    **Optional but helpful:**
    - Spreadsheet software (Excel, Google Sheets) for templates
    - Kitchen scale for tracking portions (if desired)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How long does the course take?">
    - **Total duration:** 8 weeks (12 modules)
    - **Per module:** 30-60 minutes
    - **Daily practice:** 5-10 minutes for body signal tracking
    - **Long-term maintenance:** 1-2 hours per month

    You can go at your own pace, but following the 8-week structure gives your body time to respond to changes.
  </Accordion>

## Dietary Restrictions & Medical Conditions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I do this course if I have dietary restrictions (vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, etc.)?">
    **Vegetarian:** Yes, though it's more challenging. You'll need to find protein sources without PUFAs and ensure adequate nutrients (vitamin A, B12, zinc).

    **Vegan:** This will be very difficult, as many plant proteins and fats are high in PUFAs. However, you can still learn the principles and adapt where possible.

    **Gluten-free:** Absolutely! Many course recommendations are naturally gluten-free (rice, potatoes, meat, dairy).

    **Allergies:** The experiment approach helps you identify YOUR tolerances. Adapt as needed.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is this safe if I have a medical condition (diabetes, thyroid issues, heart disease)?">
    This course focuses on eliminating processed seed oils and eating real food, which generally supports metabolic health. However:

    - **Always consult your doctor** before making dietary changes
    - This is **not medical advice**—it's education
    - If you're on medication, work with your healthcare provider to monitor changes

    Many people with metabolic conditions see improvements, but individual results vary.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I do this course while pregnant or breastfeeding?">
    Eliminating PUFAs and eating real food is generally beneficial, but:

    - **Consult your doctor or midwife** before starting
    - **Do not restrict calories** - pregnancy and breastfeeding require adequate nutrition
    - Focus on adding nutrient-dense foods rather than eliminating food groups
    - The body signal tracking can help you understand your changing needs

    This is not the time for experimentation. Prioritize nourishment.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Results & Expectations

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Will I lose weight on this course?">
    Maybe. Weight loss is NOT the primary goal—metabolic health is.

    **What typically happens:**
    - Some people lose weight as metabolism heals
    - Some gain weight initially (if undereating before)
    - Some recompose (lose fat, gain muscle)
    - Weight normalizes over 3-6 months

    Focus on temperature, energy, and how you feel—not the scale.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="When will I see results?">
    **Week 1-2:** Minimal changes (PUFAs take time to clear from cells)

    **Week 3-4:** Energy stabilizes, temperature may start rising, digestion improves

    **Week 6-8:** Noticeable temperature increase, consistent energy, metabolic shifts

    **Month 3+:** Significant metabolic improvements, hormone rebalancing, true healing

    Everyone's timeline is different. Trust the process and track your signals.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What if I don't see results after 8 weeks?">
    **Common reasons for slow results:**
    - Still consuming hidden PUFAs (check labels obsessively)
    - Not eating enough (undereating suppresses metabolism)
    - Not eating enough carbs (thyroid needs glucose)
    - High stress (cortisol blocks everything)
    - Severe metabolic damage (may take 3-6 months)

    The course teaches you how to troubleshoot using body signals and experiments.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Comparison to Other Approaches

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="I've tried keto/paleo/carnivore. How is this different?">
    **Key differences:**
    - We don't eliminate food groups dogmatically
    - We embrace strategic carbs (glucose is essential)
    - We focus on PUFA elimination over macros
    - We emphasize experimentation, not rigid rules
    - We track body signals, not calories

    If you've damaged your metabolism with low-carb, this course teaches how to heal it.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is this just another low-carb diet?">
    No! In fact, it's the opposite. This course teaches why carbs (specifically glucose) are **essential** for thyroid function and metabolic health.

    We focus on:
    - **Eliminating PUFAs** (seed oils) - the real metabolic poison
    - **Strategic carb intake** (150g+ per day for most people)
    - **Body signal tracking** to find YOUR optimal intake
    - **Experimentation** over dogma

    Many people come to this course after damaging their metabolism with low-carb diets.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do I need to count calories or track macros?">
    No. This course teaches you to track **body signals** instead:
    - Body temperature
    - Energy levels
    - Pulse rate
    - Digestion
    - How you feel

    Your body will tell you what it needs. You don't need to count anything.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Implementation & Practical Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Do I have to eliminate seed oils 100%?">
    **At home:** Yes, aim for 100% elimination.

    **When eating out:** Do your best (aim for 80-90%).

    **The 90/10 rule:** 90% compliance gives you 90% of the benefits. Perfection is not required and creates stress, which damages metabolism more than occasional PUFA exposure.

    Start with eliminating them from your kitchen, then work on social situations.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How much does this cost beyond the course itself?">
    **Ongoing costs:**
    - Real food (butter, meat, produce) costs more than processed food—budget $50-100/week extra depending on current diet
    - Digital thermometer: $10-15 (one-time)
    - Optional supplements (vitamin D, magnesium): $20-30/month if needed

    **No expensive biohacking required.** This is about food quality, not gadgets.

    **Money-saving tips:**
    - Buy butter in bulk
    - Choose ground beef over steak
    - Eggs are affordable protein
    - White rice is inexpensive
    - Skip organic if budget is tight (focus on PUFA elimination first)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="My family won't eat this way. Can I still do the course?">
    Yes! You don't need to force your family to change.

    **Strategies:**
    - Cook PUFA-free meals (they won't notice if you use butter instead of seed oil)
    - Let them add seed oil-based condiments if they want
    - Focus on your own plate
    - Lead by example (your results will speak louder than lectures)

    Most families happily eat butter, meat, potatoes, rice, and vegetables. You're just changing the cooking fat.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="I travel frequently for work. Can I still do this?">
    Yes! Module 9 teaches travel strategies:
    - Pack snacks (cheese, fruit, dark chocolate, jerky)
    - Choose better restaurants (steakhouses, Mediterranean)
    - Order strategically (grilled/baked proteins, plain starches, salads)
    - Grocery store backup (yogurt, rotisserie chicken, cheese, fruit)

    The 90/10 rule applies: do your best while traveling, return to full compliance at home.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Course Structure & Support

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I do the modules out of order?">
    We recommend following the sequence, especially:
    - **Modules 1-3** build essential knowledge
    - **Module 4** teaches body signal tracking (needed for everything after)
    - **Module 5** eliminates PUFAs (foundation for healing)

    After Module 5, you have more flexibility, but the structure is designed to build progressively.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What if I miss a week or fall off track?">
    **Don't panic.** Life happens.

    **How to recover:**
    1. Don't try to "make up for it"—just resume where you left off
    2. Return to basics: eliminate PUFAs, eat enough carbs, track temperature
    3. Give yourself 1-2 weeks to feel normal again
    4. Learn from what triggered the slip (stress, travel, social pressure?)

    Module 12 covers this in detail. This is a lifelong practice, not a perfect 8-week sprint.
