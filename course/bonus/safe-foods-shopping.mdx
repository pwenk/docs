## Shopping Tips

<Steps>
  <Step title="Read Every Label">
    **Never assume.** Even "healthy" brands sneak in seed oils.

    Look for: canola oil, vegetable oil, soybean oil, sunflower oil, safflower oil, grapeseed oil

    If it says any of those ‚Üí put it back
  </Step>

  <Step title="Shop the Perimeter">
    Real foods (meat, dairy, produce) are usually around the edges of the store.

    Middle aisles are where packaged foods (often with seed oils) live.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Buy Whole Foods">
    The less processed, the safer:
    - Steak = safe
    - Frozen pre-marinated steak = probably has seed oil

    - Potatoes = safe
    - Frozen french fries = probably seed oil

    Whole foods don't have ingredient labels to worry about.
  </Step>

  <Step title="When in Doubt, Skip It">
    If you're unsure, don't buy it.

    Stick to foods you KNOW are safe until you get better at label reading.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Find Your Safe Brands">
    Once you find safe versions of foods you like, stick with them.

    For example:
    - Jackson's Honest chips
    - Dave's Killer Bread (certain varieties)
    - Primal Kitchen condiments
    - Kerrygold butter
  </Step>
</Steps>
