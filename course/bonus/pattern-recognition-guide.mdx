## Why Patterns Matter More Than Single Data Points

One temperature reading means nothing.

Seven days of readings reveal everything.

**This guide helps you identify the patterns that indicate what's actually happening in your body.**

<Info>
The goal isn't to diagnose yourself - it's to guide your experiments. Your body will tell you what works through these patterns.

## How to Spot Patterns

### What to Track

For 7-14 days, log:
- Temperature (3x daily: morning, mid-day, evening)
- Pulse (2x daily: morning, throughout day)
- Energy (scale 1-10, multiple times per day)
- Digestion (bloating, gas, bowel movements, comfort)
- How you feel (mood, mental clarity, physical sensations)
- What you ate

### What to Look For

<Steps>
  <Step title="Trends Over Time">
    Are your signals:
    - Improving? (temp rising, energy increasing)
    - Declining? (temp dropping, energy crashing)
    - Stable? (same every day)
    - Variable? (all over the place)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Time-of-Day Patterns">
    When do you feel best/worst?
    - Morning energy vs afternoon crash?
    - Post-meal slump or sustained energy?
    - Evening fatigue or second wind?
  </Step>

  <Step title="Food Correlations">
    How do specific foods affect you?
    - Temp drop after seed oils?
    - Energy spike after fruit?
    - Bloating after certain foods?
  </Step>

  <Step title="Combined Signal Patterns">
    What do temp + pulse + energy tell you together?
    - Low all three = one story
    - High pulse + low temp = different story
    - See patterns below
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Common Metabolic Patterns

### Pattern 1: The Hypothyroid Slugger

**Signals:**
<CodeGroup>
```text Morning
Temperature: 96.8-97.2°F
Pulse: 58-65 bpm
Energy: 3-4/10 (exhausted)
Feeling: Cold hands/feet, need coffee
```

```text Mid-Day
Temperature: 97.2-97.6°F
Pulse: 62-68 bpm
Energy: 5-6/10 (functional but tired)
Feeling: Afternoon slump, brain fog
```

```text Evening
Temperature: 96.9-97.4°F
Pulse: 60-65 bpm
Energy: 4-5/10 (depleted)
Feeling: Exhausted but can't sleep well
```
</CodeGroup>

**What it means:**
- Thyroid is suppressed
- Metabolism is running slow
- Body is in energy conservation mode

**Common causes:**
- Years of PUFA accumulation
- Long-term low-carb or keto diet
- Chronic calorie restriction
- High stress, poor sleep

**What to try:**
1. **Eliminate PUFAs immediately** (see Module 5)
2. **Add strategic glucose** - fruit, honey, white rice, orange juice
3. **Increase total calories** - you may be undereating
4. **Prioritize sleep** - aim for 8+ hours
5. **Reduce stress** - cortisol suppresses thyroid

**Expected timeline:**
- Week 1-2: May feel worse before better (PUFA detox)
- Week 3-4: Temperature starts rising 0.2-0.5°F
- Month 2: Pulse increases, energy improves
- Month 3+: Consistent 98.0°F+ temps, 70-80 bpm pulse

### Pattern 2: The Stressed & Wired

**Signals:**
<CodeGroup>
```text Morning
Temperature: 97.5-98.0°F
Pulse: 85-95 bpm
Energy: 7-8/10 (but anxious/jittery)
Feeling: Wired, need coffee, heart racing
```

```text Mid-Day
Temperature: 98.0-98.4°F
Pulse: 88-98 bpm
Energy: 6-7/10 (crash after morning)
Feeling: Anxious, scattered focus
```

```text Evening
Temperature: 97.8-98.2°F
Pulse: 80-90 bpm
Energy: 3-4/10 (exhausted)
Feeling: Wired but tired, can't relax
```
</CodeGroup>

**What it means:**
- High stress hormones (cortisol, adrenaline)
- Body is compensating with fight-or-flight
- Not sustainable long-term

**Common causes:**
- Too much caffeine
- Undereating (body in panic mode)
- Overtraining without adequate recovery
- Chronic life stress
- Poor sleep quality

**What to try:**
1. **Cut caffeine by 50%** - switch to decaf or tea
2. **Eat more food** - especially carbs at each meal
3. **Reduce exercise intensity** - focus on walking, light movement
4. **Add stress management** - meditation, breathwork, yoga
5. **Improve sleep hygiene** - dark room, consistent schedule

**Expected timeline:**
- Week 1: Pulse drops 5-10 bpm as you reduce caffeine
- Week 2-3: Energy becomes more stable (less spiky)
- Month 2: Pulse stabilizes 70-85 bpm
- Long-term: Calm energy instead of wired anxiety

### Pattern 3: The Blood Sugar Roller Coaster

**Signals:**
<CodeGroup>
```text Day 1
Morning: Temp 97.8°F, Pulse 75 bpm, Energy 7/10
Mid-day: Temp 98.2°F, Pulse 80 bpm, Energy 8/10
Evening: Temp 96.9°F, Pulse 68 bpm, Energy 3/10
```

```text Day 2
Morning: Temp 97.2°F, Pulse 70 bpm, Energy 4/10
Mid-day: Temp 97.6°F, Pulse 82 bpm, Energy 6/10
Evening: Temp 98.1°F, Pulse 78 bpm, Energy 7/10
```

```text Day 3
Morning: Temp 97.5°F, Pulse 88 bpm, Energy 5/10
Mid-day: Temp 96.8°F, Pulse 72 bpm, Energy 4/10
Evening: Temp 97.9°F, Pulse 76 bpm, Energy 6/10
```
</CodeGroup>

**What it means:**
- Unstable blood sugar regulation
- Inconsistent energy availability
- Damaged metabolic flexibility

**Common causes:**
- Skipping meals or fasting
- High PUFA intake (damages mitochondria)
- Insufficient carbohydrates
- Irregular eating schedule
- Stress causing cortisol spikes

**What to try:**
1. **Eat every 3-4 hours** - no more than 4 hours between meals
2. **Include carbs at every meal** - fruit, honey, rice, potatoes
3. **Eliminate PUFAs completely** - they damage energy production
4. **Consistent meal times** - same schedule daily
5. **Don't skip breakfast** - sets tone for the day

**Expected timeline:**
- Week 1-2: Signals stabilize with consistent eating
- Week 3-4: Less variability, more predictable energy
- Month 2+: Stable patterns emerge, easier to maintain

### Pattern 4: The Post-Meal Crasher

**Signals:**
<CodeGroup>
```text Before Meal
Temperature: 98.0°F
Pulse: 75 bpm
Energy: 7/10
Feeling: Good, stable
```

```text 30-60 Min After Eating
Temperature: 97.2°F (drops 0.8°F!)
Pulse: 85 bpm (increases)
Energy: 4/10 (crashes)
Feeling: Bloated, sleepy, brain fog
```

```text 2-3 Hours Later
Temperature: 97.6°F
Pulse: 78 bpm
Energy: 5/10
Feeling: Recovering but still sluggish
```
</CodeGroup>

**What it means:**
- Food is causing inflammation or metabolic stress
- Possible PUFA reaction
- Poor digestion or food intolerance

**Common causes:**
- Eating PUFAs (seed oils, fried foods)
- Food intolerances (gluten, dairy for some)
- Large meals that overwhelm digestion
- Eating too fast, not chewing

**What to try:**
1. **Track which foods cause crashes** - keep a detailed log
2. **Eliminate suspected PUFAs** - check ingredient labels
3. **Try smaller, more frequent meals** - easier to digest
4. **Eat slowly, chew thoroughly** - aids digestion
5. **Test removing common triggers** - gluten, dairy, eggs (one at a time)

**Expected timeline:**
- Immediate: Notice which foods cause crashes
- Week 1-2: Eliminate trigger foods, see improvement
- Week 3-4: Post-meal energy should be stable or increase
- Long-term: Food energizes you instead of depleting you

### Pattern 5: The Night Owl

**Signals:**
<CodeGroup>
```text Morning
Temperature: 96.5-97.0°F
Pulse: 62-68 bpm
Energy: 2-3/10 (can barely function)
Feeling: Exhausted, foggy, need coffee
```

```text Evening
Temperature: 98.0-98.4°F (highest of day!)
Pulse: 75-85 bpm
Energy: 8-9/10 (peak energy)
Feeling: Alert, productive, not sleepy
```

```text Night (10 PM-12 AM)
Temperature: Still 97.8-98.2°F
Pulse: 70-80 bpm
Energy: 7-8/10 (should be winding down)
Feeling: Wired, can't sleep
```
</CodeGroup>

**What it means:**
- Reversed circadian rhythm
- Cortisol pattern is backwards
- Metabolism peaks when it should be declining

**Common causes:**
- Chronic stress (cortisol rises at night)
- Undereating during day, overeating at night
- Blue light exposure in evening
- Caffeine too late in day
- Irregular sleep schedule

**What to try:**
1. **Front-load calories** - larger breakfast, smaller dinner
2. **Eat carbs in morning/afternoon** - helps regulate cortisol
3. **Cut caffeine after 12 PM** - even small amounts affect sleep
4. **Evening wind-down routine** - dim lights, no screens 1 hour before bed
5. **Consistent wake/sleep times** - even weekends
6. **Morning sunlight** - resets circadian rhythm

**Expected timeline:**
- Week 1-2: Sleep may improve, energy still low in AM
- Week 3-4: Morning energy starts increasing
- Month 2: More normal energy pattern (peaks mid-day)
- Month 3+: Natural wake-up, natural sleepiness in evening

## Energy Patterns

### The Consistent Cruiser (Healthy)

**Pattern:**
- Energy builds through morning (6/10 → 8/10)
- Stable through afternoon (7-8/10)
- Natural decline in evening (5-6/10)
- Ready for bed by 10 PM

**What it means:** Healthy metabolism, good hormonal regulation

---

### The Morning Crasher (Common Problem)

**Pattern:**
- Wake exhausted (2-3/10)
- Need coffee to function
- Crashes again by 10-11 AM
- Multiple caffeine hits to survive day

**What it means:** Low blood sugar, low thyroid, adrenal stress

**Fix:** Eat breakfast with carbs, reduce caffeine, address thyroid

---

### The 2 PM Dip (Classic Blood Sugar Issue)

**Pattern:**
- Good energy morning (7-8/10)
- Lunch around noon
- Crash at 2-3 PM (3-4/10)
- Reaches for sugar or coffee

**What it means:** Blood sugar crash, insulin spike/drop

**Fix:** Eat protein + carbs at lunch, avoid high-fat meals, don't skip breakfast

---

## Digestion Patterns

### Immediate Bloating (Within 30 Minutes)

**Pattern:** Feel bloated, gassy, uncomfortable right after eating

**What it means:** Food intolerance, poor digestion, or eating too fast

**Try:** Eliminate suspected trigger foods, chew more, eat smaller portions

---

### Delayed Bloating (2-4 Hours Later)

**Pattern:** Feel fine after eating, bloated hours later

**What it means:** Fermentation in gut, possible SIBO, food moving slowly

**Try:** Reduce fiber temporarily, try digestive enzymes, identify trigger foods

---

### Diarrhea After Meals

**Pattern:** Need to rush to bathroom within 30-90 minutes of eating

**What it means:** Food intolerance, gut inflammation, or malabsorption

**Try:** Eliminate PUFAs, test for dairy/gluten issues, eat gentler foods

## The Bottom Line

<Note>
**Patterns reveal what single data points cannot.**

Don't panic if one day shows low temp or high pulse. Look at 7 days.

Don't assume you're broken if signals aren't perfect yet. You're gathering information.

**Your job:** Track → Recognize pattern → Experiment → Observe changes

Trust the process. Your body wants to be healthy - it just needs the right inputs.
