**Related Module:** [Module 9: Social Situations & Real Life](/course/phase3/module9-social-situations)

This bonus resource gives you word-for-word scripts for handling questions about your eating choices in various social situations.
</Info>

## Why This Matters

**People will ask. People will comment. People will have opinions.**

You need responses ready so you don't:
- Get defensive
- Give a 20-minute nutrition lecture
- Feel awkward or pressured
- Cave to social pressure

<Info>
**The goal:** Polite, brief responses that end the conversation without creating conflict or making things weird.
</Info>

---

## The Basic Approach

### Three-Tier Response System

**Tier 1: The Short Answer** (for casual acquaintances, strangers, people you don't want to engage with)
- Brief, vague, conversational
- Changes subject quickly
- No nutritional details

**Tier 2: The Health Version** (for friends, coworkers, people who genuinely care)
- Honest but simplified
- Focuses on how you feel, not dogma
- Invites follow-up if they're interested

**Tier 3: The Deep Dive** (for people who are genuinely curious and respectful)
- Full explanation if you want to share
- Only if you have time and energy
- Still not preachy

## Common Scenarios & Scripts

### Scenario 1: "Why aren't you eating [X]?"

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Tier 1: Short Answer">
    **Responses:**
    - "I'm just not in the mood for it today."
    - "I'm good with what I have, thanks!"
    - "Trying to eat lighter right now."
    - "I already ate." (even if you didn't)
    - "I'm not super hungry."

    **Follow up with:** Change the subject immediately
    > "How's your [work/family/project] going?"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Tier 2: Health Version">
    **Responses:**
    - "I've been avoiding seed oils - they don't make me feel great."
    - "I'm eating in a way that helps my energy levels."
    - "I'm focusing on foods that work well for my body."
    - "I've cut out certain oils and feel way better."

    **If they ask more:**
    > "Yeah, I noticed I feel better when I avoid processed oils. Temperature's up, energy's better. It's been great!"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Tier 3: Full Explanation (If They're Genuinely Curious)">
    **Response:**
    > "I've been eliminating PUFAs - seed oils like canola, soybean, sunflower oil. They're in most processed foods and can mess with metabolism and thyroid function. I started tracking my body temperature and energy, and when I cut them out, I saw huge improvements. Higher temp, better energy, better sleep. So I stick with butter, coconut oil, and real foods now."

    **If they want more:**
    > "Happy to share more if you're interested! I've learned a lot about how food affects metabolism."
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

---

### Scenario 2: "You're being too restrictive!"

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Tier 1: Deflect">
    **Responses:**
    - "Nah, I feel great actually!"
    - "I don't see it that way, but I appreciate the concern."
    - "It works for me!" (smile and move on)

    **Do NOT:** Defend yourself or argue. Just acknowledge and redirect.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Tier 2: Clarify">
    **Responses:**
    - "I'm not restricting calories or food groups - I'm just avoiding certain oils that make me feel terrible."
    - "It's not about restriction, it's about eating foods that make me feel good."
    - "I actually eat more than I used to - just different foods."
    - "I'm not dieting. I'm eating in a way that supports my metabolism."

    **If they push:**
    > "I appreciate your concern, but I'm doing this based on how my body responds. I track temperature, energy, and digestion - all have improved significantly."
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Tier 3: Set Boundary">
    **Response:**
    > "I understand it might seem restrictive from the outside, but I'm actually eating more food than I used to and feeling way better. I'm not doing this to lose weight or punish myself - I'm doing it because my body functions better this way. I've tracked my signals carefully and seen real improvements. I appreciate your concern, but I'm good."

    **If they won't let it go:**
    > "I respect that you have a different approach. This is what works for me. Let's talk about something else."
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Scenario 3: "One bite won't kill you!"

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Tier 1: Decline Politely">
    **Responses:**
    - "I'm good, thanks though!"
    - "I appreciate it, but I'll pass."
    - "Not right now, maybe later!" (and never come back)
    - "I'm full, but it looks great!"

    **Do NOT:** Explain why. Just decline and smile.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Tier 2: Light Explanation">
    **Responses:**
    - "You're right, it won't kill me - but I know I'll feel crappy later, and it's not worth it."
    - "I wish I could, but certain ingredients really mess with my energy."
    - "I know it seems like no big deal, but my body's really sensitive to seed oils."

    **If they insist:**
    > "I appreciate it, really. But I've learned what works for my body, and this isn't it. No hard feelings!"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Tier 3: Firm Boundary">
    **Response:**
    > "I know you mean well, but when I eat seed oils, my temperature drops, my energy crashes, and I feel terrible for days. It's not about being perfect - it's about not feeling like crap. So no thanks."

    **If they keep pushing:**
    > "I've said no. Please respect that."
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

---

### Scenario 4: "That's not what the science says!"

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Tier 1: Disengage">
    **Responses:**
    - "Maybe! Works for me though."
    - "Could be. I just go by how I feel."
    - "I've read different things, but I focus on my own results."

    **Do NOT:** Engage in a nutrition debate. You will not win. Move on.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Tier 2: Acknowledge and Redirect">
    **Responses:**
    - "I've read conflicting research. I just know that when I eliminated seed oils, my temperature went up, my energy improved, and I feel way better."
    - "Science can say whatever it wants - I track my own body signals, and they've improved dramatically."
    - "Interesting. I've seen studies that say the opposite. But regardless, my body responds well to this approach."

    **If they keep arguing:**
    > "I respect that we've read different things. I'm going by my own results, and they're working for me."
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Tier 3: Stand Your Ground (If You Want To Debate)">
    **Response:**
    > "Actually, the research on PUFAs is pretty damning if you look beyond the industry-funded studies. They're highly unstable, oxidize easily, damage mitochondria, and suppress thyroid function. But I'm not here to convince you - I'm just sharing what's worked for me. You do you."

    **If they won't let it go:**
    > "We can agree to disagree. I'm not trying to convert anyone - I'm just eating in a way that makes me feel good."
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

---

### Scenario 5: "You're going to get nutrient deficiencies!"

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Tier 1: Brush Off">
    **Responses:**
    - "I feel great, so I think I'm good!"
    - "I'm eating plenty of real food - not worried."
    - "I appreciate the concern!"

    **Do NOT:** List your nutrient intake. Just move on.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Tier 2: Clarify">
    **Responses:**
    - "I'm eating meat, dairy, eggs, fruit, potatoes, rice - pretty much everything except processed foods with seed oils. I'm good on nutrients."
    - "I'm not restricting food groups - just specific oils. I'm eating more nutrient-dense foods than ever."
    - "I actually track my signals carefully - temperature, energy, digestion - and everything has improved."

    **If they mention specific nutrients:**
    > "I eat a variety of whole foods - meat, dairy, fruit, vegetables, starches. I'm not cutting out any essential nutrients."
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Tier 3: Full Explanation">
    **Response:**
    > "I'm eating a wide variety of whole foods: beef, chicken, fish, eggs, dairy, fruit, potatoes, rice, vegetables. The only things I avoid are seed oils and highly processed foods. If anything, I'm eating MORE nutrient-dense foods than when I was eating a 'balanced' diet full of processed junk. My energy, temperature, and digestion have all improved - no signs of deficiency."
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Scenario 6: At a Restaurant with Friends

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Ordering Without Making It Weird">
    **What to do:**
    - Order normally
    - Ask simple questions ("Can you make this with butter instead of oil?")
    - Don't announce your dietary preferences to the table

    **What to say to server:**
    > "I have a sensitivity to seed oils - can you cook this in butter or olive oil instead?"

    **If your friends ask:**
    > "Oh, I just feel better when I avoid certain oils. No big deal!" (and change subject)
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="If They Choose a Restaurant You Can't Eat At">
    **Option 1: Make it work**
    - Find something on the menu (salad, grilled meat, etc.)
    - Eat before you go and order something small

    **Option 2: Suggest alternative**
    > "That place looks great! I'm also down for [steakhouse/breakfast spot/Mexican]. What do you all think?"

    **Option 3: Be honest (if close friends)**
    > "Honestly, that place doesn't have much I can eat without feeling terrible later. Would you be open to [alternative]? If not, I can eat beforehand and just come for drinks/company!"
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="If Everyone Wants to Split a Dish You Can't Eat">
    **What to say:**
    - "You all share that - I'll get my own thing!"
    - "I'm not super into that, but you guys go for it!"
    - "I'm good with what I ordered, enjoy!"

    **Do NOT:** Explain why you can't eat it unless asked.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Scenario 7: Family Gatherings (The Hardest)

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="When Grandma Made Her Famous [Dish]">
    **Option 1: Eat a small portion**
    - If it's genuinely important to family harmony
    - If it's a rare occasion (holidays, special events)
    - Accept that your temp might dip and you'll recover

    **What to say:**
    > "This is delicious, Grandma. Thank you for making it." (and have a small serving)

    **Remember:** One meal won't ruin you. Connection > perfect diet.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="When Mom Says 'I Made This Especially for You!'">
    **If you want to eat it:**
    > "Thank you so much! I really appreciate it." (and eat it without guilt)

    **If you don't want to eat it:**
    > "Mom, I appreciate the thought so much. I'm trying to avoid certain ingredients right now, but I love that you thought of me. Can I have [something else on the table]?"

    **If she's hurt:**
    > "I'm not rejecting your cooking - I know it's delicious. I'm just eating in a specific way for my health right now. I love you, and I appreciate you."
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="When Family Won't Stop Commenting">
    **Set a boundary:**
    > "I appreciate everyone's concern, but I'm an adult and I've made this decision based on how my body responds. I'm not asking anyone else to eat this way. Can we please talk about something else?"

    **If they keep pushing:**
    > "I'm not discussing this anymore. [Change subject forcefully.]"

    **If it's really bad:**
    - Eat before you arrive
    - Bring your own food (explain it's for your health)
    - Limit time at gathering
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

    **Do NOT:** Get defensive. Just move on.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Tier 2: Clarify">
    **Responses:**
    - "I follow the 90/10 rule - I'm flexible when it matters. This isn't about perfection or fear."
    - "I'm not anxious about food - I'm just eating in a way that makes me feel good."
    - "If I was orthorexic, I'd be obsessing and restricting. I'm eating more than I used to and enjoying food."

    **If they push:**
    > "I track my temperature, energy, and mood - they've all improved. This isn't about control or fear, it's about feeling good."
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Tier 3: Set Boundary">
    **Response:**
    > "I appreciate your concern, but I'm not orthorexic. I have clear reasons for eating this way based on how my body responds. I'm not restricting calories, I'm not stressed about food, and I'm flexible when it matters. If you're genuinely worried about me, I'm happy to talk more - but please don't label my health choices as a disorder."
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Scripts by Relationship Type

### For Strangers / Acquaintances

**Keep it simple:**
- "I feel better when I avoid certain oils."
- "I'm good with what I have, thanks!"
- "Just a personal preference."

**Change subject immediately.** You owe them no explanation.

---

### For Coworkers

**Professional but brief:**
- "I'm eating in a way that helps my energy levels."
- "I've cut out certain oils - makes a big difference for me."
- "I feel better when I eat this way."

**If they're genuinely interested:**
- Share briefly (1-2 sentences)
- Offer to send them info later if they want
- Don't turn lunch into a nutrition seminar

---

### For Friends

**Honest but not preachy:**
- "I started tracking my body temperature and energy, and when I eliminated seed oils, everything improved."
- "I'm eating to support my metabolism - it's been game-changing."
- "I know it seems weird, but my temp went up, my energy is way better, and I sleep great now."

**If they want to try it:**
- Share resources
- Be supportive but don't push
- Let them make their own decision

---

### For Family

**Pick your battles:**
- Eat what you can without making it weird
- Bring your own food if needed (blame it on your "sensitive stomach")
- Have 1-2 small portions of special dishes if it keeps the peace
- Stand firm on non-negotiables but be flexible on "worth it" foods

**If they won't stop commenting:**
- Set clear boundaries
- Remove yourself from situation if needed
- Remember: You're an adult and don't owe them an explanation

---

### For Romantic Partners

**Be honest and clear:**
- Explain why it matters to you (how you feel, your signals)
- Show them the data (temp improvements, energy, etc.)
- Ask for support, not perfection
- Be flexible when eating out or traveling together

**If they're not supportive:**
- Explain how important this is for your health
- Ask them to try it with you for 2 weeks (see if they notice improvements)
- Stand firm if it's a non-negotiable for you

---

## The Golden Rules

### 1. You Don't Owe Anyone an Explanation

**Your body. Your choice. Your results.**

If you don't want to explain, don't. "I feel better this way" is a complete sentence.

---

### 2. Don't Preach Unless Asked

**No one likes the nutrition evangelist.**

Share if people are genuinely curious. Don't lecture.

---

### 3. Pick Your Battles

**Not every comment needs a response.**

Sometimes the best answer is a smile and a subject change.

---

### 4. Be Confident, Not Defensive

**You know what works for your body.**

Speak confidently. Don't apologize. Don't over-explain.

---

### 5. The 90/10 Rule Applies to Social Situations Too

**Connection > perfection.**

If eating Grandma's casserole keeps family peace, eat it. If skipping the birthday cake keeps you feeling good, skip it.

**You decide what's "worth it."**

---

## Quick Reference: Response Cheat Sheet

**"Why aren't you eating X?"**
→ "I feel better when I avoid certain oils."

**"One bite won't hurt!"**
→ "I'm good, thanks though!"

**"You're being too restrictive!"**
→ "I'm eating more than I used to, just different foods."

**"That's not what science says!"**
→ "I go by how I feel, and I feel great."

**"You'll get deficiencies!"**
→ "I'm eating plenty of whole foods - not worried."

**"You're orthorexic!"**
→ "I'm not stressed about food - I just eat what makes me feel good."

**Family pressure:**
→ "I appreciate your concern, but this is working for me."

**Restaurant with friends:**
→ Order normally, ask for butter instead of oil, don't make it weird

---

## The Bottom Line

<Note>
**You will face questions, comments, and pressure.**

**The key:** Have responses ready. Be polite but firm. Don't over-explain unless they're genuinely curious.

**Remember:**
- Most people comment because they feel uncomfortable with your choices (not because they care about your health)
- You don't owe anyone an explanation
- Connection matters more than perfect adherence
- Confidence shuts down most comments

**Trust yourself. Stand your ground. Live your life.**
