title: "Mindset Shifts & Self-Conception"
description: "Change your self-conception before changing everything else - reframing beliefs about your body, weight, and worth"
---

## The Most Important Shift

**You can change how you see yourself RIGHT NOW.**

You don't have to wait until you:
- Lose weight
- Hit your goal temperature
- Perfect your protocol
- "Fix" yourself

<Info>
**Your self-conception** (how you see yourself, what you believe about yourself) **determines your reality** more than any diet ever will.
</Info>

---

## What Is Self-Conception?

**Self-conception = The story you tell yourself about who you are.**

Examples:
- "I'm someone who struggles with weight"
- "I'm naturally low energy"
- "I'm not disciplined enough"
- "I always fail at diets"
- "I'm broken/damaged/unfixable"

**These beliefs create your reality.**

If you believe you're "someone who struggles with weight," you will unconsciously act in ways that confirm that belief.

**The good news:** You can change these beliefs anytime.

## The Shift: From Broken to Experimenting

### Old Story

<CodeGroup>
```text Before
"I'm broken. My metabolism is damaged. I've tried everything and nothing works. I'm doomed to feel terrible forever. I lack willpower. I'm not disciplined enough."
```
</CodeGroup>

**This story:**
- Makes you a victim
- Removes your agency
- Creates hopelessness
- Guarantees failure

---

### New Story

<CodeGroup>
```text After
"I'm an experimenter. My body is giving me signals, and I'm learning to read them. I'm discovering what works for MY body through testing and tracking. I trust my body to guide me."
```
</CodeGroup>

**This story:**
- Makes you a scientist
- Gives you agency
- Creates curiosity
- Enables success

---

## Reframing Exercise: Change the Story

<Steps>
  <Step title="Identify Your Old Belief">
    What negative story do you tell yourself about your body, health, or weight?

    Examples:
    - "I can't lose weight"
    - "I'm always tired"
    - "I have no willpower"
    - "My thyroid is broken"
    - "I'm too old to change"

    **Write it down:**
    ```
    My old story: ________________________________
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Question the Belief">
    Ask yourself:
    - Is this actually true, or is it just a story I've been telling myself?
    - What evidence contradicts this belief?
    - What if this belief is just based on trying the WRONG approaches (low-cal diets, excessive exercise, ignoring body signals)?

    **Example:**
    - Old belief: "I can't lose weight"
    - Question: What if I couldn't lose weight because I was eating PUFAs that suppressed my metabolism, not because I'm broken?
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a New Story">
    Rewrite your belief from a place of curiosity and experimentation.

    **Formula:**
    "I'm someone who [positive action] and my body [positive response]."

    **Examples:**
    - Old: "I can't lose weight" → New: "I'm learning what foods support my metabolism, and my body responds when I give it what it needs"
    - Old: "I'm always tired" → New: "I'm discovering how to support my energy through body signals, and I'm already seeing improvements"
    - Old: "I have no willpower" → New: "I'm listening to my body instead of fighting it, which feels way better than forcing myself"

    **Write your new story:**
    ```
    My new story: ________________________________
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Act From the New Story">
    What would someone with your NEW belief do differently?

    **Example:**
    - Old story person: Restricts calories, fights hunger, feels guilty
    - New story person: Tracks signals, experiments with foods, trusts body's feedback

    **Your action step:**
    ```
    Based on my new story, I will: ________________________________
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## The "I Can Look Great" Reframe

### Why This Matters

**Many people unconsciously believe:** "I can't be attractive / I'm not the type of person who looks good / I'll never have that body."

**This belief is a self-fulfilling prophecy.**

If you believe you can't look great, you won't take actions that lead to looking great (even if you're "trying" to lose weight).

---

### The Shift

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Old Belief">
    **"I'll never look like that."**

    **What this creates:**
    - Hopelessness
    - Giving up before you start
    - Self-sabotage ("Why bother?")
    - Resentment toward people who "have it easy"

    **Result:** You don't look great (belief confirmed)
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="New Belief">
    **"I'm becoming someone who feels confident and looks great in their body."**

    **What this creates:**
    - Hope and possibility
    - Consistent action
    - Self-respect
    - Curiosity about what works

    **Result:** You actually start looking and feeling better (belief confirmed)
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

---

### How to Adopt This Belief (Even If You Don't Believe It Yet)

<Steps>
  <Step title="Act As If">
    **Ask yourself:** "What would someone who looks great and feels confident in their body do?"

    Then do that thing.

    **Examples:**
    - They'd track their signals (not restrict calories)
    - They'd eat foods that support metabolism (not starve)
    - They'd prioritize sleep and stress management
    - They'd dress well NOW (not "when I lose weight")
    - They'd move their body joyfully (not punish themselves)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Find Evidence">
    Look for ANY evidence that you're capable of changing.

    **Examples:**
    - "My temp went up 0.3°F this week"
    - "I had more energy yesterday"
    - "I slept better last night"
    - "I felt confident in that outfit"

    **Write down 3 pieces of evidence:**
    1. ________________________________
    2. ________________________________
    3. ________________________________
  </Step>

  <Step title="Visualize Future You">
    **Close your eyes. Imagine:**
    - You, 6 months from now, feeling great
    - Higher temperature, consistent energy, clear mind
    - Looking in the mirror and feeling confident
    - Moving through the world with ease

    **How does that version of you act? What choices do they make?**

    Start making those choices now.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Common Mindset Blocks (And How to Reframe Them)

### Block 1: "I've tried everything and nothing works"

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why This Belief Exists">
    You've tried:
    - Low-calorie diets (failed)
    - Keto (felt terrible)
    - Intermittent fasting (crashed)
    - Excessive exercise (exhausted)

    **Conclusion:** "Nothing works for me."
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="The Reframe">
    **New belief:** "I tried approaches that damaged my metabolism. I'm now trying an approach that SUPPORTS my metabolism."

    **Key insight:** You didn't fail. The approaches failed you.

    **Action:** This time, you're tracking signals, eliminating PUFAs, eating adequate carbs, and trusting your body. This is different.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

---

### Block 2: "I lack willpower / discipline"

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why This Belief Exists">
    You've "failed" at restrictive diets, felt out of control around food, given in to cravings.

    **Conclusion:** "I'm weak. I lack discipline."
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="The Reframe">
    **New belief:** "I'm not lacking willpower - my body was starving for nutrients and energy because I was suppressing my metabolism."

    **Key insight:** Cravings and "lack of discipline" are often your body screaming for energy when metabolism is suppressed.

    **Action:** Support your metabolism (eliminate PUFAs, eat carbs, track signals). Watch cravings diminish naturally.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

---

### Block 3: "I'm too old / too damaged / too far gone"

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why This Belief Exists">
    You've struggled for years/decades. You feel like you've "ruined" your metabolism or missed your window.

    **Conclusion:** "It's too late for me."
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="The Reframe">
    **New belief:** "My body is resilient. Metabolism can heal at any age when given the right inputs."

    **Key insight:** PUFA elimination and metabolic support work at 25, 45, and 65. Your body wants to heal.

    **Action:** Track your signals. Watch them improve regardless of age. Your body is waiting for you to give it what it needs.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

---

### Block 4: "I don't deserve to feel good"

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why This Belief Exists">
    Deep shame, past trauma, belief that you need to "earn" health through suffering.

    **Conclusion:** "I'm not worthy of feeling good."
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="The Reframe">
    **New belief:** "Feeling good is my birthright. My body WANTS to feel good. I don't have to earn it."

    **Key insight:** You're not being punished. Your body isn't broken because you're bad. You just need the right inputs.

    **Action:** Give yourself permission to feel good. Nourish yourself. Track signals without judgment.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## The "Metabolic Meditation" Practice

**A 5-minute practice for connecting with your body:**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Sit Comfortably">
    Find a quiet space. Close your eyes. Take 3 deep breaths.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Body Scan">
    **Notice:**
    - How does your body feel right now?
    - What's your energy level?
    - Do you feel warm or cold?
    - Is your digestion comfortable?
    - What's your mood?

    **No judgment. Just notice.**
  </Step>

  <Step title="Gratitude">
    **Say to your body:**
    "Thank you for communicating with me. Thank you for giving me signals. I'm listening. I trust you."

    **Feel appreciation for your body** (even if it's not perfect yet)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Intention">
    **Set an intention:**
    "Today, I will listen to my body and give it what it needs."

    Or:
    "I trust my body to guide me toward what works."

    Or:
    "I'm becoming someone who feels great and trusts their body."
  </Step>

  <Step title="Open Eyes">
    Take one more deep breath. Open your eyes. Move through your day from this place of trust and connection.
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Do this daily** (morning or evening). It takes 5 minutes and rewires your relationship with your body.
