## Travel Doesn't Have to Derail You

**The goal isn't perfection when traveling.**

The goal is to **maintain 70-80% of your protocol** while actually enjoying your trip.

<Info>
Perfect adherence while traveling = miserable trip. Strategic adherence while traveling = feel great AND have fun.

## Pre-Travel Prep

### 1 Week Before

<Steps>
  <Step title="Research Your Destination">
    **Google:**
    - "Best restaurants in [city]"
    - "Steakhouses near [hotel]"
    - "Grocery stores near [location]"
    - "Farmer's markets in [city]"

    **Look for:**
    - Restaurants that cook with butter/olive oil
    - Grocery stores for emergency snacks
    - Hotels with kitchenettes (if extended stay)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Pack Your Essentials">
    See packing list below â†’
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set Realistic Expectations">
    **Accept:**
    - You will probably eat seed oils at some point
    - Your temperature might dip temporarily
    - You won't track as meticulously

    **Remember:**
    - 3-7 days of imperfect eating won't ruin months of progress
    - Stress is worse for metabolism than a little seed oil
    - Connection and experiences > perfect diet
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Packing List: Travel Essentials

### Snacks (TSA-Friendly)

**Bring these in your carry-on:**
- **Beef jerky** (Epic, Chomps, Nick's Sticks - check for seed oils!)
- **Fruit** (apples, oranges, bananas - easy to carry)
- **Dark chocolate** (Hu Kitchen, Eating Evolved)
- **Cheese sticks** (if short flight or with ice pack)
- **Nut butter packets** (almond or cashew, in moderation)
- **Honey packets** (for quick energy)
- **Dried fruit** (dates, apricots, mango)

**For checked luggage:**
- **Coconut oil** (small jar for cooking in hotel)
- **Butter** (grass-fed, in travel container if staying somewhere with fridge)
- **Salt** (small container for seasoning bland food)
- **Protein powder** (optional, if you want backup meals)

<Warning>
**TSA liquid rules:** Liquids must be 3.4 oz (100ml) or less in carry-on. Honey, nut butter, and coconut oil count as liquids!

Pack larger amounts in checked luggage.
</Warning>

### Tools & Supplements

**Consider bringing:**
- **Thermometer** (track temps to see how travel affects you)
- **Magnesium** (for sleep in new time zones)
- **Vitamin D** (if you're not getting much sun)
- **Digestive enzymes** (if eating foods you normally don't)
- **Electrolytes** (for flights, long days walking)

---

## Airport & Flight Strategy

### Before Security

**Best options:**
- **Eggs + bacon** (ask for butter, not oil)

---

### On the Plane

### What to Say at Restaurants

**Script 1: Simple Request**
> "Can you cook this in butter instead of oil?"

**Script 2: Allergy Approach (if they push back)**
> "I have a sensitivity to seed oils - can you use butter or olive oil instead?"

**Script 3: Calling Ahead**
> "Hi, I'm coming for dinner tonight. I can't eat seed oils like canola or vegetable oil. Can your kitchen accommodate that with butter or olive oil?"

**Script 4: Ask First**
> "What oil do you use for cooking? ... Is it possible to use butter instead?"

<Note>
**Most restaurants are accommodating** if you ask politely. Worst case: they say no, and you order something that's not cooked in oil (salad, steak, baked potato).
</Note>

## Day-of Travel Tips

### Morning of Travel

**Eat a solid breakfast before leaving:**
- Eggs + toast with butter + fruit
- Oatmeal with butter, honey, and fruit
- Greek yogurt with honey and berries

**Why:** Starts the day with stable blood sugar, reduces reliance on airport food

---

### During Travel Day

**Priorities:**
1. **Stay hydrated** - Drink water constantly
2. **Eat regularly** - Don't skip meals (blood sugar crashes make everything worse)
3. **Choose best available option** - It won't be perfect, that's okay

**Emergency meal hierarchy:**
1. **Best:** Real food restaurant (steak, eggs, etc.)
2. **Good:** Grocery store (rotisserie chicken, fruit, cheese)
3. **Okay:** Packaged snacks (jerky, fruit, nuts, chocolate)
4. **Last resort:** Airport fast food (burger no bun, grilled chicken)

---

### Evening (First Night at Destination)

**Find dinner that night:**
- Use Google Maps / Yelp for "best restaurants near me"
- Look for steakhouse, breakfast place, or Mexican
- Call ahead if needed to ask about cooking oils

**Stock your hotel room:**
- Find nearest grocery store
- Buy: Fruit, jerky, cheese, dark chocolate, milk (if fridge)

---

## Handling Social Pressure While Traveling

### "Try this! It's the local specialty!"

**Option 1 (if you want to):**
> "Okay, I'll have a small taste!" (and enjoy it without guilt)

**Option 2 (if you don't want to):**
> "I appreciate it, but I'm good with what I have. Thanks though!"

**Option 3 (middle ground):**
> "That looks amazing! I'm going to stick with [simpler option], but you enjoy it!"

---

### Group Meals Where You Can't Control the Menu

**Strategy:**
- Eat the protein (meat, fish, eggs)
- Eat the carbs (rice, potatoes, bread with butter)
- Eat the fruit/vegetables
- Skip the fried items, creamy sauces, and obviously seed-oil-laden foods
- Don't stress about perfection

**Remember:** One group meal with seed oils won't undo your progress. Enjoy the company.

---

## Post-Travel Recovery

### When You Get Home

<Steps>
  <Step title="Don't Panic">
    Your temp might be down. Your digestion might be off. You might feel a bit sluggish.

    **This is normal.** You likely ate seed oils, didn't sleep great, and were stressed.

    **It's temporary.**
  </Step>

  <Step title="Return to Your Protocol Immediately">
    - Eliminate all seed oils (back to strict mode)
    - Eat regular meals with carbs
    - Prioritize sleep
    - Drink lots of water

    **Don't compensate** by restricting or fasting. Just return to normal.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Give It 3-7 Days">
    Your body will bounce back quickly if you return to your protocol.

    - Temperature should normalize in 3-5 days
    - Digestion should settle in 2-4 days
    - Energy should return in 2-3 days

    **Track your signals** to see recovery progress.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Learn for Next Time">
    **What went well?**
    - Which restaurants were safe?
    - Which snacks were most helpful?
    - What strategies worked?

    **What didn't?**
    - What made you feel terrible?
    - What would you avoid next time?

    Adjust your travel strategy accordingly.
  </Step>
</Steps>

- Stock room with eggs, butter, fruit, rice, rotisserie chicken
- Eat 1-2 meals in room, 1 meal at safe restaurant

---

- Find grocery stores early
- Learn key phrases ("Can you cook with butter?" in local language)
- Prioritize protein, carbs, and fruit
- Accept that seed oils will happen - minimize but don't stress

---

### Road Trip

**Strategy:**
- Pack cooler with: cheese, milk, fruit, butter, cooked eggs, rotisserie chicken
- Bring shelf-stable snacks: jerky, chocolate, honey packets, dried fruit
- Plan stops at grocery stores instead of only fast food
- Find diners for eggs and bacon

---

## The Bottom Line

<Note>
**Travel is about experiences, not perfect eating.**

**The goal:**
- Maintain 70-80% of your protocol (eliminate seed oils when possible, eat regularly, prioritize protein + carbs)
- Enjoy your trip without food anxiety
- Return to 100% protocol when you get home

**Your metabolism can handle a few days of imperfect eating.** Stress about it will harm you more than the occasional seed oil.

**Trust your body. Pack smart. Do your best. Live your life.**
