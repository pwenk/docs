## The Truth About Supplements

**Most supplements are unnecessary if you're eating real food.**

But a few can be helpful, especially during metabolic recovery or if you have specific deficiencies.

<Warning>
**This is not medical advice.** These are suggestions based on common metabolic support needs. Consult a healthcare provider if you have health conditions or take medications.
</Warning>

<Info>
**Philosophy:** Food first, supplements second. Never use supplements to compensate for a terrible diet.
</Info>

## The Short List (Only 5)

These are the ONLY supplements most people should consider:

1. **Vitamin D3 + K2**
2. **Magnesium**
3. **Selenium**
4. **Thyroid Support (if needed)**
5. **Collagen/Gelatin (optional)**

That's it. You don't need 20 bottles of pills.

## 1. Vitamin D3 + K2

### Why It Matters

**Vitamin D:**
- Supports thyroid function
- Regulates calcium absorption
- Immune function
- Mood and energy

**Most people are deficient** (especially if you live in northern climates or don't get much sun).

**Vitamin K2:**
- Works synergistically with D3
- Directs calcium to bones (not arteries)
- Important for bone and heart health

### Who Needs It

**You probably need it if:**
- You live north of the 37th parallel (most of US, Canada, Europe)
- You work indoors most of the day
- You avoid sun exposure
- You have low energy, mood issues, or frequent illness

### Dosage

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Maintenance Dose">
    **Vitamin D3:** 2,000-4,000 IU daily

    **Vitamin K2 (MK-7):** 100-200 mcg daily

    **Take with:** Fat-containing meal (D and K are fat-soluble)

    **When:** Morning with breakfast
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Loading Dose (If Deficient)">
    **Vitamin D3:** 5,000-10,000 IU daily for 1-3 months

    **Vitamin K2 (MK-7):** 200 mcg daily

    **Then:** Reduce to maintenance dose

    **Get tested:** Check vitamin D levels after 3 months
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Brand Recommendations

**Best Options:**
- **Thorne D/K2 Liquid:** Easy to dose, high quality
- **Sports Research D3 + K2:** Coconut oil base, affordable
- **Now Foods D3 & K2:** Budget-friendly, effective
- **Life Extension Super K:** Comprehensive K2 formula

**What to look for:**
- D3 (cholecalciferol), not D2
- K2 as MK-7 (more bioavailable)
- Combined formula or take separately

## 2. Magnesium

### Why It Matters

Magnesium is involved in **300+ enzymatic reactions** including:
- Energy production (ATP)
- Muscle relaxation
- Sleep quality
- Stress response
- Blood sugar regulation

**Most people are deficient** (modern soil is depleted, stress depletes it).

### Who Needs It

**You probably need it if:**
- You have trouble sleeping
- You get muscle cramps or tension
- You're stressed or anxious
- You have headaches or migraines
- Your energy is low

### Dosage

**Daily dose:** 300-500 mg elemental magnesium

**Best forms:**
- **Magnesium Glycinate:** Best for sleep, relaxation, non-laxative
- **Magnesium Threonate:** Best for brain health, focus
- **Magnesium Citrate:** Good absorption, mild laxative effect (good if constipated)
- **Magnesium Taurate:** Good for heart health

**Avoid:**
- Magnesium Oxide (poor absorption, laxative effect)

**When to take:**
- **For sleep:** 300-400 mg glycinate 1 hour before bed
- **For energy:** 200 mg citrate or threonate in morning
- **Can split dose:** AM and PM

### Brand Recommendations

**Best Options:**
- **Thorne Magnesium Bisglycinate:** High quality, clean
- **Doctor's Best Magnesium Glycinate:** Affordable, effective
- **Life Extension Magnesium Caps:** Multiple forms
- **Natural Vitality Calm:** Magnesium citrate powder (good for constipation)

## 3. Selenium

### Why It Matters

Selenium is **critical for thyroid function:**
- Required for T4 → T3 conversion (active thyroid hormone)
- Protects thyroid from oxidative damage
- Supports immune function

**Many people are deficient** (soil depletion, especially in certain regions).

### Who Needs It

**You probably need it if:**
- You have low thyroid symptoms (low temp, fatigue, cold hands/feet)
- You live in selenium-poor soil regions (Great Lakes, Pacific Northwest, Northeast US)
- You don't eat brazil nuts or seafood regularly

### Dosage

**Daily dose:** 100-200 mcg

<Warning>
**Don't exceed 400 mcg daily** - selenium can be toxic at high doses. More is NOT better.
</Warning>

**Food sources (best):**
- **Brazil nuts:** 1-2 nuts daily = ~100 mcg (easiest way to get selenium!)
- **Seafood:** Tuna, sardines, shrimp
- **Organ meats:** Liver, kidney

**Supplement (if needed):**
- 100-200 mcg daily
- Take with food

### Brand Recommendations

**Best Options:**
- **Thorne Selenium:** 200 mcg, clean formula
- **Now Foods Selenium:** 200 mcg, affordable
- **Life Extension Selenium:** 200 mcg, multiple forms

**Or just eat:**
- **2 Brazil nuts daily** (cheapest, most bioavailable!)

## 4. Thyroid Support (If Needed)

### When to Consider

**Only if:**
- You have confirmed hypothyroid symptoms (low temp, low pulse, fatigue)
- You've eliminated PUFAs and added carbs but temp is still low after 2-3 months
- You've ruled out other causes (stress, undereating, poor sleep)

<Warning>
**Start with food and lifestyle changes first.** Most "low thyroid" is PUFA damage and insufficient carbs - not true hypothyroidism.
</Warning>

### Options

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Iodine (Use Cautiously)">
    **What it is:** Essential mineral for thyroid hormone production

    **Who needs it:** People with confirmed iodine deficiency (rare in US due to iodized salt)

    **Dosage:** 150-300 mcg daily (from kelp, iodized salt, or supplement)

    **Warning:** High-dose iodine (>1000 mcg) can worsen thyroid issues in some people. Start low.

    **Best sources:**
    - Iodized salt (use liberally on food)
    - Seaweed/kelp
    - Eggs, dairy, fish

    **Brands:**
    - **Thorne Iodine & Tyrosine**
    - **NOW Kelp**
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Thyroid Glandular (Animal-Based)">

## Do I Need This? (Decision Tree)

### Vitamin D + K2

**Ask yourself:**
- Do I get 20+ minutes of midday sun daily?
- Do I live in a sunny climate year-round?

**No to both?** → **Take D3 + K2**

**Yes to both?** → Maybe not needed (but get tested to confirm)

---

### Magnesium

**Ask yourself:**
- Do I sleep well?
- Am I relaxed and stress-free?
- Do I eat magnesium-rich foods daily (dark chocolate, nuts, leafy greens, beans)?

**No to any?** → **Take magnesium glycinate**

---

### Selenium

**Ask yourself:**
- Do I eat 2 Brazil nuts daily?
- Do I eat seafood or organ meats regularly?

**No to both?** → **Take selenium 100-200 mcg** (or eat 2 Brazil nuts)

**Yes to either?** → You're probably fine

---

### Thyroid Support

**Ask yourself:**
- Is my mid-day temp consistently below 97.5°F after 2-3 months of PUFA elimination and adequate carbs?
- Have I addressed stress, sleep, and calorie intake?

**Yes to both?** → **Consider thyroid support or see a doctor**

**No?** → Fix diet/lifestyle first

---

### Collagen

**Ask yourself:**
- Do I eat bone broth, slow-cooked meats, or organ meats regularly?
- Do I have gut issues, joint pain, or skin concerns?

**No to first, yes to second?** → **Try collagen 10-20g daily**

**Yes to first?** → Probably don't need it

---

## What You DON'T Need

### Skip These (Usually Useless or Overhyped)

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Multivitamins">
    **Why skip:** Nutrients are better absorbed from food. Most multis have cheap, poorly-absorbed forms. You'll pee out most of it.

    **Better:** Eat real food, target specific deficiencies if needed
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Omega-3 Fish Oil">
    **Why skip:** PUFAs (yes, even omega-3s) are fragile and oxidize easily. Fish oil capsules are often rancid.

    **Better:** Eat fish 2-3x/week for whole-food omega-3s
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Probiotics (for most people)">
    **Why skip:** Expensive, questionable effectiveness, strains may not colonize

    **Better:** Eat fermented foods (yogurt, kefir, sauerkraut, kimchi)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Greens Powders">
    **Why skip:** Overpriced, minimal nutrient absorption

    **Better:** Eat actual vegetables
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Fat Burners / Metabolism Boosters">
    **Why skip:** Don't work. Most are just caffeine and marketing.

    **Better:** Fix your diet (eliminate PUFAs, eat carbs, track signals)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Ashwagandha (for most people)">
    **Why skip:** Can suppress thyroid in some people. Overhyped.

    **Better:** Manage stress through sleep, rest, and lifestyle changes
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
