---

**Time to Complete:** 45 minutes

**Priority:** Important (if considering GLP-1 drugs) ⭐⭐⭐

<Warning>
  **This module is for people considering or currently using GLP-1 agonists (Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro, etc.) for weight loss.**

  If you're not using these drugs, you can skip this—but the metabolic principles apply to ANY weight loss approach.
</Warning>

## What You'll Learn

- What GLP-1 drugs actually do (beyond appetite suppression)
- Why they work short-term but fail long-term
- The metabolic price: muscle loss, aging, thyroid suppression
- How to use GLP-1s WITHOUT destroying your metabolism
- Why fixing metabolism first matters more than the scale

## What Are GLP-1 Agonist Drugs?

GLP-1 (Glucagon-Like Peptide-1) agonists are a class of drugs originally developed for Type 2 diabetes, now widely used for weight loss.

</CardGroup>

### How They Work

GLP-1 drugs mimic a natural hormone (GLP-1) that your gut releases after eating. This hormone:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Slows Gastric Emptying">
    Food stays in your stomach longer → you feel fuller longer
  </Step>

  <Step title="Suppresses Appetite">
    Acts on brain receptors (hypothalamus) → you feel less hungry
  </Step>

  <Step title="Improves Insulin Sensitivity">
    Helps cells respond better to insulin → better glucose control
  </Step>

  <Step title="Reduces Food Noise">
    Decreases obsessive thoughts about food → easier to eat less
  </Step>
</Steps>

**The result:** You eat significantly less. Weight comes off.

**The problem:** What KIND of weight are you losing? And at what metabolic cost?

## Why GLP-1 Drugs Work (Short-Term)

Let's be honest: **GLP-1 drugs are extremely effective for rapid weight loss.**

### The Upside

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Rapid Weight Loss">
    Average weight loss: 15-20% of body weight over 6-12 months

    Some people lose 30-50+ pounds

    **This is real.** The drugs work.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Improved Blood Sugar">
    Better glucose control

    Lower HbA1c (for diabetics)

    Reduced insulin resistance

    **Useful for Type 2 diabetics**
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Reduced Food Obsession">
    "Food noise" disappears

    Less binge eating

    Easier to stick to eating plan

    **Psychological relief for many**
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Cardiovascular Benefits">
    Lower blood pressure

    Reduced inflammation markers

    Lower triglycerides

    **Correlates with weight loss**
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

**So what's the problem?**

The problem isn't that GLP-1s don't work. It's **what happens when you lose weight this way.**

## The Metabolic Price: What You're Actually Losing

Here's what nobody tells you about GLP-1 weight loss:

**You're not just losing fat. You're losing muscle, bone density, and metabolic capacity.**

### The Composition Problem

<CodeGroup>

```text Healthy Weight Loss (High Protein, Strength Training, Adequate Calories)
Fat loss: 80-90%
Muscle loss: 10-20%
Metabolic rate: Maintained or slightly reduced
Body composition: Leaner, tighter, younger-looking
```

```text GLP-1 Weight Loss (Low Appetite, Inadequate Protein, No Strength Training)
Fat loss: 60-70%
Muscle loss: 30-40%
Metabolic rate: SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED
Body composition: "Skinny fat," loose skin, older-looking
```

</CodeGroup>

### What This Looks Like

<Warning>
**The "Ozempic Face" phenomenon is real:**
- Loss of facial fat and muscle
- Hollow cheeks, saggy skin
- Looking 5-10 years older
- Accelerated aging appearance

**Why?** Because you're not just losing fat—you're losing structural tissue (muscle, collagen) that keeps you looking youthful.
</Warning>

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="What People Expect" icon="smile" color="#16A34A">
    - Lose 40 pounds

  <Card title="What Often Happens" icon="face-frown" color="#ef4444">
    - Lose 40 pounds (30 fat + 10 muscle)
    - Look gaunt and older
    - Lower energy (suppressed metabolism)

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## The Metabolic Damage Cascade

Here's what happens when you use GLP-1s without fixing the underlying metabolism:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Appetite Suppression → Undereating">
    GLP-1s make you eat less (that's the point)

    But "less" often means WAY less—people report eating 500-1000 calories/day

    **Your body perceives this as starvation**
  </Step>

  <Step title="Starvation Signal → Thyroid Suppression">
    Low calorie intake signals famine

    Body downregulates thyroid (T4 converts to reverse T3 instead of active T3)

    **Metabolism slows to conserve energy**

    (See Module 7: Thyroid & Hormones for why this happens)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Low Metabolism → Muscle Catabolism">
    Body needs energy, but you're not eating enough

    Muscle is broken down for amino acids (gluconeogenesis)

    **You lose muscle FAST on GLP-1s + low calories**
  </Step>

  <Step title="Muscle Loss → Further Metabolic Decline">
    Less muscle = lower resting metabolic rate

    Now you need even FEWER calories to maintain weight

    **Metabolic rate crashes**
  </Step>

  <Step title="Stop the Drug → Rapid Rebound">
    GLP-1 wears off, appetite returns

    But metabolism is now 300-500 calories LOWER than before

    Weight comes back (often MORE than you lost)

    **"Ozempic rebound" is real**
  </Step>
</Steps>

### The Numbers

<Info>
**Study data on muscle loss with GLP-1s:**

- **Without resistance training:** 30-40% of weight lost is muscle
- **With resistance training + adequate protein:** 15-25% muscle loss (better, but still significant)

**Metabolic rate reduction:**
- Expected from weight loss alone: 10-15% decrease
- Observed with rapid GLP-1 weight loss: 20-30% decrease

**Why the bigger drop?** Muscle loss, thyroid suppression, and metabolic adaptation (starvation mode).

## The Ray Peat Lens: Why This Matters

From a bioenergetic perspective (Ray Peat's framework, which underpins this course):

**Metabolism is king. The scale is a lagging indicator.**

### What Matters More Than Weight

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Body Temperature">
    **Healthy metabolism:** Average temp 98.0-98.6°F

    **Suppressed metabolism (common on GLP-1s):** Temp drops to 96.5-97.5°F

    **Why this matters:** Temperature reflects thyroid function and mitochondrial efficiency

    **What it means:** Low temp = low metabolic rate = weight regain inevitable
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Pulse Rate">
    **Healthy metabolism:** Resting pulse 70-85 bpm (non-athletes)

    **Suppressed metabolism:** Resting pulse drops to 55-65 bpm

    **Why this matters:** Pulse reflects cardiac output and metabolic demand

    **What it means:** Low pulse = body in conservation mode
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Energy Levels">
    **Healthy metabolism:** Stable energy all day, no crashes

    **Suppressed metabolism:** Constant fatigue, need stimulants (coffee, etc.)

    **Why this matters:** Energy = ATP production = functional mitochondria

    **What it means:** Low energy = broken metabolism, even if weight is down
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Hormonal Function">
    **Healthy metabolism:** Normal sex drive, regular cycles (women), stable mood

    **Suppressed metabolism:** Low libido, irregular periods, mood issues

    **Why this matters:** Sex hormones depend on thyroid function and adequate nutrition

    **What it means:** Hormonal dysfunction = metabolism is sacrificed for weight loss
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

**The principle:** If you lose weight but your temperature drops, pulse slows, energy crashes, and hormones tank—**you've damaged your metabolism.** The weight will come back.

## The Wrong Way vs. The Right Way

### The Wrong Way (How Most People Use GLP-1s)

<Warning>
**Common pattern:**
1. Start GLP-1 drug
2. Eat 500-1000 calories/day (appetite gone)
3. Lose weight rapidly (15-20 lbs/month)
4. Don't track protein or do strength training
5. Feel great initially (high on weight loss + stress hormones)
6. Months 4-6: Energy crashes, hair falls out, skin sags
7. Stop drug (too expensive, side effects, or reached goal)
8. Appetite returns with a vengeance
9. Metabolism is 400 cal/day lower now
10. Gain all weight back (plus more)

**Result:** Worse off than before—lower muscle mass, slower metabolism, older appearance
</Warning>

### The Right Way (If You Must Use GLP-1s)

<Note>
**Strategic approach:**
1. **Fix metabolism FIRST** (eliminate PUFAs, adequate carbs, body signals improving)
2. **Use GLP-1 as a bridge** (not a crutch)
3. **Eat adequate calories** (minimum 1500-1800 cal/day, personalized to your needs)
4. **Prioritize protein** (1g per pound of goal body weight)
5. **Strength train 3-4x/week** (protect muscle mass)
6. **Monitor body signals** (temp, pulse, energy—if they drop, EAT MORE)
7. **Supplement strategically** (see Module 10: Supplements)
8. **Taper slowly** (don't stop abruptly)
9. **Build sustainable habits** (so you don't need the drug long-term)

**Result:** Weight loss with metabolic preservation—you keep the weight off
</Note>

## The GLP-1 + Metabolism Protocol

If you're going to use GLP-1 drugs, follow this protocol to minimize metabolic damage:

### 1. Pre-GLP-1: Build Metabolic Foundation (4-8 weeks)

**Before starting the drug:**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Eliminate PUFAs">
    Remove seed oils from your diet (see Module 2)

    This protects thyroid and mitochondria during weight loss
  </Step>

  <Step title="Establish Baseline Body Signals">
    Track morning temp, pulse, energy for 2 weeks

    You need to know your starting point to detect metabolic suppression
  </Step>

  <Step title="Dial In Protein Intake">
    Practice eating 120-150g protein/day (adjust for body size)

    Build the habit before appetite disappears
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start Strength Training">
    3x/week full-body workouts

    Muscle is use-it-or-lose-it—start NOW
  </Step>
</Steps>

### 2. During GLP-1: Protect Metabolism

**While using the drug:**

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Nutrition Non-Negotiables">
    **Minimum 1500 calories/day** (women) or 1800 cal/day (men)

    - Even if not hungry
    - Use liquid calories if needed (smoothies, bone broth, whole milk)

    **Protein target: 1g per pound of GOAL body weight**

    - 150 lb goal weight = 150g protein/day
    - Non-negotiable to preserve muscle

    **150g carbs MINIMUM per day**

    - Supports thyroid function (T4 to T3 conversion)
    - Prevents metabolic slowdown
    - Fruit, white rice, potatoes, honey

    **Safe fats:**

    - Butter, ghee, coconut oil
    - NO seed oils (ever)
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Training Non-Negotiables">
    **Strength training 3-4x/week**

    - Heavy, compound movements (squats, deadlifts, presses)
    - Muscle stimulus signals "keep this tissue"

    **Daily walking**

    - 7,000-10,000 steps
    - Gentle metabolic stimulus without stress

    **Avoid excessive cardio**

    - Long cardio = catabolic (muscle-wasting)
    - Keep cardio under 30 min/session
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Monitoring Non-Negotiables">
    **Track body signals WEEKLY:**

    - Morning body temp (goal: maintain 98.0°F+)
    - Resting pulse (goal: maintain 70+ bpm)
    - Energy levels (goal: stable all day)
    - Sleep quality
    - Mood and libido

    **If ANY signal drops:**

    - Increase calories by 200-300/day
    - Increase carbs by 50g/day
    - Reduce GLP-1 dose (talk to prescriber)

    **Scale weight is secondary**

    Body signals > scale number
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Supplement Support">
    **Essential supplements during GLP-1 use:**

    **Magnesium glycinate:** 400mg/day
    - Supports muscle, sleep, metabolism

    **Selenium:** 200mcg/day (2-3 Brazil nuts)
    - Supports thyroid (T4 to T3 conversion)

    **Vitamin D3:** 4000-5000 IU/day
    - Muscle preservation, immune support

    **Collagen/Gelatin:** 20g/day
    - Skin elasticity, connective tissue support
    - Helps prevent "Ozempic face"

    **Optional but helpful:**

    - Creatine 5g/day (muscle preservation)
    - Taurine 1-2g/day (metabolic support)
    - B vitamins (energy, methylation)

    See Module 10 for detailed supplement guidance
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### 3. Tapering Off: Protect Against Rebound

**When stopping GLP-1:**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Taper Slowly (8-12 weeks)">
    Don't stop cold turkey

    Reduce dose by 25% every 2-3 weeks

    Gives metabolism time to re-adapt
  </Step>

  <Step title="Increase Calories Gradually">
    Add 100-200 cal/week as you taper

    Focus on carbs (metabolism support)

    Expect 2-5 lbs water weight gain (normal, not fat)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Continue Strength Training">
    This is FOREVER, not just during weight loss

    Muscle is metabolically active tissue

    More muscle = higher metabolic rate
  </Step>

  <Step title="Monitor Body Signals">
    Temp and pulse should RISE as you taper (good sign)

    If weight creeps up but temp/pulse stay high → normal metabolic recovery

    If weight creeps up AND temp/pulse drop → metabolism still suppressed, adjust food
  </Step>
</Steps>

## The Uncomfortable Truth

Here's what the GLP-1 marketing doesn't tell you:

**You can't drug your way out of a broken metabolism.**

### Why People Regain the Weight

Studies show that **2/3 of people regain most or all of the weight** within 12 months of stopping GLP-1 drugs.

**Why?**

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="They Never Fixed the Underlying Metabolism">
    PUFAs still in diet → thyroid still suppressed

    Undereating during weight loss → metabolism crashed

    No muscle gain → metabolic rate stays low

    **The foundation was never built**
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="They Lost Too Much Muscle">
    Muscle is metabolically expensive tissue

    Losing 20 lbs muscle = 200-300 cal/day lower metabolic rate

    Now they need to eat LESS to maintain weight

    **Unsustainable**
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="They Relied on the Drug, Not Habits">
    GLP-1 = artificial appetite suppression

    Never learned sustainable eating patterns

    Never addressed food environment, stress, sleep

    **Drug was a band-aid, not a solution**
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="They Didn't Track Body Signals">
    Scale went down = "success"

    But temp dropped, energy crashed, hormones tanked

    Metabolism was destroyed in pursuit of a number

    **Weight loss at the cost of health**
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## The Real Solution: Fix Metabolism, Then Lose Weight

Here's the approach that actually works long-term:

### Phase 1: Build Metabolic Capacity (8-12 weeks)

**Goal:** Raise metabolism BEFORE attempting weight loss

<Steps>
  <Step title="Eliminate PUFAs">
    Remove seed oils completely (Module 2)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Eat Adequate Calories">
    Eat at maintenance or slight surplus

    150g+ carbs/day minimum

    Don't restrict yet
  </Step>

  <Step title="Track Body Signals">
    Monitor temp, pulse, energy daily

    Goal: Temp rising toward 98.0°F+, pulse 70-80 bpm
  </Step>

  <Step title="Build Strength">
    Resistance training 3-4x/week

    Add muscle (muscle = metabolic capacity)
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Result:** Your metabolism RISES. You feel warmer, more energized, hormonally balanced.

### Phase 2: Strategic Fat Loss (12-16 weeks)

**Goal:** Lose fat while preserving metabolism

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Modest Deficit">
    300-500 cal/day deficit (not 1000+)

    Slow and steady (1-2 lbs/week max)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Keep Carbs High">
    150-200g carbs/day (supports thyroid)

    Cut calories from fat, not carbs
  </Step>

  <Step title="Maintain Protein">
    1g per pound of goal weight

    Protects muscle during deficit
  </Step>

  <Step title="Monitor Signals">
    If temp/pulse drop → eat more

    Body signals > scale
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Result:** You lose fat, keep muscle, maintain metabolic rate.

### Optional: GLP-1 as a Bridge Tool

**If you choose to use GLP-1 during Phase 2:**

- Follow the "During GLP-1" protocol above
- Use lowest effective dose
- Keep duration under 6 months
- Taper slowly
- Continue tracking body signals

**The drug is a TOOL, not the strategy.**

## Who Should Consider GLP-1s?

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Good Candidates">
    **People who might benefit:**

    - Severe obesity (BMI 35+) where rapid weight loss reduces immediate health risks
    - Type 2 diabetics with poor glucose control
    - People who will COMMIT to the full protocol (nutrition, training, monitoring)
    - Those using it as a SHORT-TERM bridge (3-6 months max)

    **With the understanding that:**
    - It's not a permanent solution
    - Metabolism must be protected
    - Habits must be built
    - Tapering is essential
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Poor Candidates">
    **People who should avoid GLP-1s:**

    - Anyone expecting it to "fix" their metabolism
    - People unwilling to track body signals
    - Those who won't strength train or prioritize protein
    - Anyone with a history of disordered eating (GLP-1s can worsen restriction)
    - People with existing thyroid issues (GLP-1s + undereating = severe suppression)
    - Those who haven't eliminated PUFAs first

    **Why?**
    - You'll lose weight, destroy metabolism, rebound
    - You'll look older and feel worse
    - Waste of money and health
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## The Body Signal Reality Check

**Ask yourself:**

- Is your morning body temp 98.0°F or higher?
- Is your resting pulse 70-80 bpm?
- Do you have stable energy all day?
- Are your hormones balanced (libido, cycles, mood)?
- Are you sleeping well?

**If NO to multiple → your metabolism is already suppressed.**

**Using GLP-1s now will make it WORSE.**

**Fix metabolism first. Lose weight second.**

## Your Assignment

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="1. Assess Your Metabolic Readiness">
    **Take the Metabolic Health Self-Assessment:**

    - Morning body temperature (7 days average)
    - Resting pulse (7 days average)
    - Energy levels (1-10 scale)
    - Sleep quality
    - Hormonal function (libido, cycles, mood)

    **If 3+ signals are poor → DO NOT start GLP-1s**

    Complete Phase 1-2 of this course first (build metabolism)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="2. Calculate Your Minimums">
    **If you're already on GLP-1s or planning to start:**

    Calculate your minimum daily intake:

    - **Protein:** Goal body weight × 1g = ___ grams
    - **Carbs:** 150g minimum (more if active)
    - **Total calories:** Minimum 1500 (women) or 1800 (men)

    **Write this down. This is your floor, not your ceiling.**
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="3. Design Your Strength Training Plan">
    **If using GLP-1s, strength training is NON-NEGOTIABLE.**

    Create a 3-4 day/week plan:

    - Full-body compound movements
    - Progressive overload (add weight weekly)
    - 45-60 min sessions
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="4. Set Up Body Signal Tracking">
    **Commit to weekly monitoring:**

    - Morning temp
    - Resting pulse
    - Energy (1-10)
    - Weight (least important metric)

    **If signals drop, adjust immediately.**
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this module, you should:

✓ Understand what GLP-1 drugs do (and what they DON'T do)
✓ Know the metabolic risks (thyroid suppression, muscle loss, rebound)
✓ Recognize why most people regain the weight
✓ Have a plan to use GLP-1s strategically (if you choose to)
✓ Understand why fixing metabolism comes BEFORE weight loss

## The Bottom Line

<Note>
  **GLP-1 drugs are effective for weight loss. But weight loss ≠ health.**

  If you lose 40 pounds but:
  - Your metabolism crashes
  - You lose 15 pounds of muscle
  - Your temp drops to 97°F
  - You look 10 years older
  - You regain it all in 12 months

  **Was it worth it?**

  The sustainable path:
  1. Fix metabolism (eliminate PUFAs, adequate nutrition, build capacity)
  2. Lose fat strategically (protect muscle, monitor signals)
  3. Build habits (so you never need a drug to maintain)

  **Use GLP-1s as a bridge if you must. But never as the foundation.**
</Note>

## What's Next?

This bonus module fits between **Module 7 (Thyroid & Hormones)** and **Module 8 (Personal Protocol)**.

If you're considering GLP-1s or are currently using them, integrate the principles from this module into your Personal Protocol (Module 8).
