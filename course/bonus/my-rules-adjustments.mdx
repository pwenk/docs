## Your Rules, Not Mine

This isn't about following someone else's dogma.

**This is about creating YOUR personal guidelines** based on what your body tells you.

<Info>
The goal: A flexible framework that works for YOUR life, YOUR body, YOUR preferences - not rigid rules that make you miserable.
</Info>

## How to Create Your Personal Rules

### Step 1: Start with Non-Negotiables

These are the things you've learned **absolutely matter** for your body through experimentation.

**Examples:**
- "I must eliminate seed oils completely - they always make my temp drop"
- "I need carbs at breakfast or I crash by 10 AM"
- "I can't skip meals without feeling terrible"
- "Dairy makes me bloated - I avoid it"

<CodeGroup>
```text Template
MY NON-NEGOTIABLES:

1. ___________________________________________
   (Why: _____________________________________)

2. ___________________________________________
   (Why: _____________________________________)

3. ___________________________________________
   (Why: _____________________________________)
```

```text Example
MY NON-NEGOTIABLES:

1. No seed oils ever - they crash my temperature
   (Why: Consistent 1°F temp drop after eating them)

2. Eat within 1 hour of waking
   (Why: Skipping breakfast = brain fog and 2 PM crash)

3. Include carbs at lunch and dinner
   (Why: Energy is stable with carbs, crashes without)
```
</CodeGroup>

---

### Step 2: Define Your Flexibility Rules

These are guidelines that work **most of the time** but have acceptable exceptions.

**Examples:**
- "I aim for 3 meals a day, but 2 is fine if I'm genuinely not hungry"
- "I prefer whole milk, but if I'm out, 2% is okay"
- "I usually avoid gluten, but won't stress about it when traveling"

<CodeGroup>
```text Template
MY FLEXIBILITY RULES:

1. GUIDELINE: _________________________________
   EXCEPTION: _________________________________

2. GUIDELINE: _________________________________
   EXCEPTION: _________________________________

3. GUIDELINE: _________________________________
   EXCEPTION: _________________________________
```

```text Example
MY FLEXIBILITY RULES:

1. GUIDELINE: Eat 3 meals daily, no snacking
   EXCEPTION: If genuinely hungry, snack on fruit/cheese

2. GUIDELINE: Avoid eating out more than 2x per week
   EXCEPTION: Social events and travel - prioritize connection

3. GUIDELINE: Limit caffeine to 1 coffee before noon
   EXCEPTION: Special occasions or when sleep was poor
```
</CodeGroup>

---

### Step 3: Identify Your "Worth It" Foods

These are foods that **technically** aren't optimal, but you've decided they're worth it for enjoyment, social connection, or practicality.

**Examples:**
- "I eat pizza once a week (even with seed oil) because I love it and it's worth the temp dip"
- "I drink beer on weekends even though alcohol affects my sleep"
- "I eat my grandma's cooking no matter what's in it"

<Note>
**The 90/10 rule:** If you're doing everything right 90% of the time, the 10% won't wreck you. Life is meant to be lived.
</Note>

<CodeGroup>
```text Template
MY "WORTH IT" EXCEPTIONS:

1. ___________________________________________
   (Frequency: ____________, Why worth it: ________________)

2. ___________________________________________
   (Frequency: ____________, Why worth it: ________________)
```

```text Example
MY "WORTH IT" EXCEPTIONS:

1. Pizza with friends Friday nights
   (Frequency: Weekly, Why: Social connection > perfect diet)

2. My mom's cooking when I visit
   (Frequency: Monthly, Why: Family time matters more)

3. Craft beer at my favorite brewery
   (Frequency: 2x/month, Why: I genuinely enjoy it)
```

## When to Adjust Your Protocol

### Signals That Mean "Keep Going"

**Don't change anything if:**
- Temperature is rising or stable (98.0°F+)
- Pulse is in healthy range (70-85 bpm)
- Energy is consistent and good
- Digestion is comfortable
- You feel good overall

✅ **Action: Maintain current protocol**

---

### Signals That Mean "Something's Off"

**Consider adjusting if:**
- Temperature drops or stays low (below 97.5°F) for 7+ days
- Pulse drops below 65 bpm or spikes above 90 bpm
- Energy crashes return
- Digestion gets worse (bloating, constipation, diarrhea)
- You feel worse overall despite following protocol

⚠️ **Action: Identify what changed and experiment**

---

## How to Adjust (One Variable at a Time)

### The Golden Rule

**NEVER change multiple things at once.**

If you change 3 things and feel better, you don't know which one worked.
If you change 3 things and feel worse, you don't know which one failed.

**Change ONE thing. Track for 3-7 days. Assess.**

---

### Adjustment Framework

<Steps>
  <Step title="Identify the Problem">
    What signal is off?
    - Low temperature?
    - Poor energy?
    - Digestive issues?
    - Something else?
  </Step>

  <Step title="Form a Hypothesis">
    What might be causing it?

    Examples:
    - "My temp dropped when I added dairy back - maybe I'm reacting to it"
    - "I've been more stressed lately - maybe I need more carbs"
    - "I started skipping breakfast - maybe that's why I'm crashing"
  </Step>

  <Step title="Make ONE Change">
    Test your hypothesis:
    - Remove suspected trigger (if you think something is causing problems)
    - Add suspected solution (if you think you're missing something)

    Examples:
    - Remove dairy for 7 days
    - Add 50g more carbs daily
    - Start eating breakfast again
  </Step>

  <Step title="Track for 3-7 Days">
    Monitor your signals:
    - Temperature
    - Pulse
    - Energy
    - Digestion
    - How you feel

    Did it improve? Get worse? Stay the same?
  </Step>

  <Step title="Assess and Decide">
    **If signals improved:** Keep the change
    **If signals worsened:** Reverse the change
    **If no change:** Try something different or give it more time
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Common Adjustments for Common Issues

### Issue: Low Temperature (Below 97.5°F)

**Possible Fixes (Try One):**

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Add More Carbs">
    **What to do:** Increase carbs by 50-100g daily

    **How:** Add fruit at breakfast, extra rice at lunch/dinner, honey in tea

    **Why:** Glucose supports thyroid function and raises metabolic rate

    **Track for:** 7 days

    **Expected result:** Temp rises 0.2-0.5°F
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Increase Total Calories">
    **What to do:** Add 200-300 calories per day

    **How:** Larger portions, add snacks (fruit + cheese, toast with butter)

    **Why:** Undereating suppresses metabolism

    **Track for:** 7 days

    **Expected result:** Temp rises, energy improves
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Reduce Stress">
    **What to do:** Cut exercise intensity by 50%, add rest days

    **How:** Replace HIIT with walking, yoga, or light activity

    **Why:** Excessive stress suppresses thyroid

    **Track for:** 7 days

    **Expected result:** Temp stabilizes, recovery improves
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Check for Hidden PUFAs">
    **What to do:** Audit your diet for sneaky seed oils

    **How:** Re-read all labels, eliminate eating out for 7 days

    **Why:** Even small amounts of PUFA can suppress metabolism

    **Track for:** 7 days

    **Expected result:** Temp rises if PUFAs were the issue
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

---

### Issue: Energy Crashes (Especially Afternoon)

**Possible Fixes (Try One):**

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Don't Skip Breakfast">
    **What to do:** Eat within 1 hour of waking

    **What to eat:** Protein + carbs (eggs + toast, yogurt + fruit, oatmeal with butter)

    **Why:** Skipping breakfast = blood sugar instability all day

    **Expected result:** More stable energy, no 2 PM crash
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Add Carbs to Lunch">
    **What to do:** Include 50-100g carbs at midday meal

    **What to eat:** Rice, potato, fruit, bread

    **Why:** Carbs stabilize blood sugar and prevent afternoon crash

    **Expected result:** Sustained energy through afternoon
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Reduce Caffeine">
    **What to do:** Cut coffee by 50% or switch to tea

    **Why:** Too much caffeine causes energy spikes and crashes

    **Expected result:** More stable energy, less jittery feeling
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Eat More Frequently">
    **What to do:** Eat every 3-4 hours instead of 2-3 large meals

    **Why:** Prevents blood sugar drops between meals

    **Expected result:** Consistent energy without crashes
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Issue: Digestive Problems (Bloating, Gas, Discomfort)

**Possible Fixes (Try One):**

1. **Eliminate dairy for 7 days** → See if bloating improves
2. **Reduce fiber temporarily** → Try white rice instead of brown, less raw vegetables
3. **Eat smaller, more frequent meals** → Easier to digest
4. **Slow down and chew more** → Aids digestion significantly
5. **Test for gluten sensitivity** → Remove bread/pasta for 7 days, see if it helps

**Track:** Bloating, gas, bowel movements, comfort after eating

---

### Issue: Poor Sleep

**Possible Fixes (Try One):**

1. **Eat carbs with dinner** → Helps serotonin/melatonin production
2. **Cut caffeine after 12 PM** → Even afternoon coffee affects sleep
3. **No large meals within 2 hours of bed** → Digestion disrupts sleep
4. **Consistent sleep schedule** → Same bedtime/wake time daily
5. **Reduce evening light exposure** → Dim lights, no screens 1 hour before bed

**Track:** Sleep quality (1-10), how easily you fall asleep, wake-ups during night

---

## When NOT to Adjust

### Don't React to Single Data Points

**Bad approach:**
- One day of low temp → panic and change everything

**Good approach:**
- 7 days of consistent low temp → adjust one variable

---

### Don't Change Things During High Stress

If you're:
- Sick
- Traveling
- Going through major life stress
- Sleep-deprived from temporary circumstances

**Don't make protocol changes.** Your signals will be off anyway. Wait until life stabilizes.

---

### Don't Adjust If It's Working

**If your signals are good and you feel great, don't change anything just because:**
- You read something new online
- Someone told you to try X diet
- You think you "should" be eating differently

**If it's working, keep doing it.**

## Examples of Real Student Protocols

### Example 1: Sarah's Protocol

**Non-Negotiables:**
1. No seed oils ever - temp drops 1°F within hours
2. Eat breakfast within 1 hour of waking - prevents afternoon crash
3. Minimum 150g carbs daily - energy crashes without them

**Flexibility Rules:**
1. Aim for 3 meals, snack if genuinely hungry
2. Prefer organic dairy, but conventional is fine
3. Limit eating out to 2x/week, but social events are exceptions

**"Worth It" Foods:**
- Sourdough pizza Friday nights (weekly)
- Wine with dinner when out with friends (2x/month)
- My grandma's cooking no matter what (monthly)

---

### Example 2: Mike's Protocol

**Non-Negotiables:**
1. No PUFAs - they destroy my energy
2. Carbs at every meal - low-carb wrecked my thyroid before
3. At least 8 hours sleep - non-negotiable for temp/energy

**Flexibility Rules:**
1. Usually 2 meals + snack, but listen to hunger
2. Prefer grass-fed beef, but any beef is fine
3. Coffee before noon only, but travel = exception

**"Worth It" Foods:**
- Beer at my favorite brewery (2x/month)
- Burgers when traveling (even with bun/fries)
- Holiday meals with family (no restrictions)

---

## The Bottom Line

<Note>
**Your protocol should feel sustainable, not restrictive.**

If you're miserable, you're doing it wrong.

The goal: Feel great 90% of the time, live your life 100% of the time.

**Adjust based on signals, not dogma. Trust your body.**
