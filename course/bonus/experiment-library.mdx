## How to Use This Library

**This is your metabolic experimentation toolkit.**

Each experiment is designed to help you discover what works for YOUR body through systematic testing.

<Info>
**Remember:** You are the scientist. Your body gives you feedback through signals (temperature, pulse, energy, digestion). Trust that feedback over any dogma.

## Experiment Guidelines

### Before Starting Any Experiment

<Steps>
  <Step title="Establish Baseline">
    Track your signals for 3-7 days BEFORE making any changes:
    - Temperature (3x daily)
    - Pulse (2x daily)
    - Energy (throughout day)
    - Digestion
    - How you feel overall
  </Step>

  <Step title="Change ONE Variable">
    **Only change ONE thing at a time.**

    If you change multiple variables, you won't know what worked (or didn't).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Track During Experiment">
    Continue tracking the same signals daily throughout the experiment
  </Step>

  <Step title="Assess Results">
    After the experiment duration, compare:
    - Before signals vs. After signals
    - Did they improve, worsen, or stay the same?
  </Step>

  <Step title="Decide">
    **If signals improved:** Keep the change
    **If signals worsened:** Reverse the change
    **If no change:** Either give it more time or try something different
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Difficulty Levels

**Easy:** Low commitment, quick results, minimal disruption
**Medium:** Moderate commitment, 1-2 weeks, some lifestyle adjustment
**Hard:** High commitment, 2-4 weeks, significant lifestyle change

---

## EASY EXPERIMENTS (Start Here)

### Experiment #1: Add Strategic Carbs

**Difficulty:** Easy
**Duration:** 7 days
**Best for:** Low-carb dieters, people with low morning temperature

**What to do:**
Add 50-100g carbs daily, distributed across meals:
- Breakfast: Fruit (banana, berries) or toast with honey
- Lunch: Rice, potato, or fruit
- Dinner: Rice, potato, or bread

**What to track:**
- Morning temperature (should rise)
- Energy throughout day (should stabilize)
- Sleep quality (may improve)
- Mood (may improve)

**Expected results:**
- Temperature increases 0.2-0.5°F
- Energy more stable (fewer crashes)
- Better sleep
- Improved mood

**Why it works:** Carbs support thyroid function (T4 → T3 conversion) and provide glucose for energy production

**Keep or discard?**
- **Keep if:** Temp rises, energy improves, you feel better
- **Discard if:** No change after 7-10 days (though rare)

---

### Experiment #2: Eat Breakfast Within 1 Hour of Waking

**Difficulty:** Easy
**Duration:** 7 days
**Best for:** People who skip breakfast, afternoon crashers

**What to do:**
Eat within 1 hour of waking, including protein + carbs:
- Example: Eggs + toast with butter + fruit
- Or: Greek yogurt with honey and berries
- Or: Oatmeal with butter, maple syrup, and banana

**What to track:**
- Morning energy vs. afternoon energy
- 2-3 PM crash (should disappear)
- Overall energy stability
- Mood throughout day

**Expected results:**
- No more afternoon crash
- Stable energy all day
- Better mood
- Potentially higher temperature

**Why it works:** Stabilizes blood sugar from the start, prevents cortisol spike that happens when you skip breakfast

**Troubleshooting:**
- "I'm not hungry in the morning" → Start small (fruit + yogurt), appetite will increase over time

---

### Experiment #3: Increase Total Calories by 200-300

**Difficulty:** Easy
**Duration:** 7 days
**Best for:** People eating <2000 calories, low temperature, chronic dieters

**What to do:**
Add 200-300 calories daily through:
- Larger portions at meals
- Adding snacks (fruit + cheese, toast with butter and honey)
- Extra butter/coconut oil in cooking
- Full-fat dairy instead of low-fat

**What to track:**
- Temperature (should rise)
- Energy (should improve)
- Pulse (may increase slightly - this is good!)
- Mood and mental clarity

**Expected results:**
- Temperature rises 0.2-0.5°F within a week
- Energy increases
- Pulse may rise 5-10 bpm (sign of increased metabolism)
- Feel warmer overall

**Why it works:** Undereating suppresses metabolism. More food = more energy available = higher metabolic rate

**Common concern:** "Won't I gain weight?"
- **Short answer:** Possibly a little initially (2-3 lbs), but metabolism will increase and weight stabilizes
- **Long-term:** Higher metabolism means you can eat more without gaining

---

### Experiment #4: Replace Seed Oils with Butter/Coconut Oil

**Difficulty:** Easy
**Duration:** 7 days
**Best for:** Everyone (this is non-negotiable long-term)

**What to do:**
For 7 days, cook ONLY with:
- Butter
- Ghee
- Coconut oil
- Tallow/lard

Eliminate ALL seed oils:
- No canola, vegetable, soybean, sunflower, safflower, corn, grapeseed oil
- Check labels on everything
- Don't eat out (too risky for this experiment)

**What to track:**
- Temperature (should rise significantly)
- Energy (should improve dramatically)
- Digestion (should feel better)
- Inflammation (joint pain, skin issues may improve)
- Brain fog (should clear)

**Expected results:**
- Temperature increase 0.5-1.0°F
- Major energy improvement
- Less bloating
- Clearer thinking
- Better sleep

**Why it works:** PUFAs damage mitochondria (energy factories) and suppress thyroid. Eliminating them allows metabolism to recover.

**This should become permanent.** This isn't optional.

---

### Experiment #5: Eat Orange Juice + Salt in Morning

**Difficulty:** Easy
**Duration:** 3-7 days
**Best for:** Morning low energy, low morning temperature

**What to do:**
Upon waking, drink:
- 8 oz (240ml) fresh-squeezed orange juice (or store-bought, no added sugar)
- Pinch of salt (1/4 tsp)

Wait 30 minutes, then eat breakfast.

**What to track:**
- Morning energy (should increase)
- How quickly you "wake up"
- Mid-morning energy
- Temperature by mid-day

**Expected results:**
- Faster morning "wake up"
- More alert by mid-morning
- Stable blood sugar through morning
- Potentially higher temperature

**Why it works:** Glucose + sodium + potassium (from OJ) quickly replenishes liver glycogen, raises blood sugar, supports adrenal function

**Troubleshooting:**
- "Won't the sugar spike my blood sugar?" → No, the fructose in OJ refills liver glycogen without spiking insulin

---

## MEDIUM EXPERIMENTS (Once You've Done the Easy Ones)

### Experiment #6: Eliminate Dairy for 14 Days

**Difficulty:** Medium
**Duration:** 14 days
**Best for:** People with bloating, skin issues, or digestive discomfort

**What to do:**
Remove ALL dairy for 14 days:
- No milk, cheese, yogurt, butter (use ghee or coconut oil instead), cream, ice cream

After 14 days, reintroduce one dairy product at a time and track response.

**What to track:**
- Bloating (should decrease if dairy is an issue)
- Skin (acne, eczema may improve)
- Digestion (bowel movements, gas)
- Congestion/mucus (may decrease)
- Energy (note any changes)

**Expected results IF dairy is a problem for you:**
- Less bloating
- Clearer skin
- Better digestion
- Less congestion

**Expected results IF dairy is NOT a problem:**
- No significant change

**How to reintroduce:**
- Day 15: Add butter (least reactive)
- Day 17: Add hard cheese (cheddar, parmesan)
- Day 19: Add soft cheese (brie, cream cheese)
- Day 21: Add yogurt
- Day 23: Add milk

Track reaction to each. You may find you tolerate some but not others.

**Why it works:** Some people have lactose intolerance, casein sensitivity, or A1 beta-casein issues. Elimination reveals if dairy is problematic for YOU.

---

### Experiment #7: Eat 3 Meals, Zero Snacks

**Difficulty:** Medium
**Duration:** 14 days
**Best for:** People who snack constantly, blood sugar instability

**What to do:**
Eat 3 substantial meals daily, ZERO snacking between:
- Breakfast (within 1 hour of waking)
- Lunch (4-5 hours after breakfast)
- Dinner (4-5 hours after lunch)

Make meals large enough to sustain you. Include protein + carbs + fat at each meal.

**What to track:**
- Energy between meals (should be stable)
- Hunger levels (should normalize)
- Digestion (may improve)
- Blood sugar stability (fewer swings)

**Expected results:**
- More stable energy (no crashes)
- Natural hunger at meal times
- Better digestion (gut gets rest between meals)
- Simplified eating

**Why it works:** Constant snacking keeps insulin elevated, prevents fat oxidation, stresses digestion. Spacing meals allows blood sugar to stabilize.

**Troubleshooting:**
- "I'm starving between meals" → Make meals bigger, include more carbs
- "I get shaky" → You may need to ease into this with 3 meals + 1 snack initially

---

### Experiment #8: Increase Protein to 100g+ Daily

**Difficulty:** Medium
**Duration:** 14 days
**Best for:** Low protein eaters, people recovering from restrictive diets

**What to do:**
Aim for 100-120g protein daily from:
- Meat (beef, chicken, pork, lamb)
- Fish and seafood
- Eggs
- Dairy (yogurt, cheese, milk)

**Sample day:**
- Breakfast: 3 eggs + yogurt = 30g
- Lunch: 6 oz (170g) chicken breast = 40g
- Dinner: 6 oz (170g) steak = 40g
- Snacks: Cheese, milk = 10g
- **Total: 120g**

**What to track:**
- Energy (may improve)
- Muscle recovery (if you exercise)
- Satiety (should feel more satisfied)
- Mood (may improve)
- Hair/skin/nails (may improve over weeks)

**Expected results:**
- Better satiety
- More stable energy
- Improved recovery
- Better body composition over time

**Why it works:** Protein provides amino acids for neurotransmitters, hormones, tissue repair. Many people undereat protein.

**Balance with collagen:** If eating 100g+ muscle meat, consider adding gelatin/collagen (10-20g) to balance amino acids

---

### Experiment #9: Cut Caffeine by 50%

**Difficulty:** Medium
**Duration:** 14 days
**Best for:** High caffeine consumers, anxious energy, poor sleep

**What to do:**
Reduce caffeine intake by half:
- If you drink 3 cups coffee → drink 1.5 cups
- Or switch to half-caff
- Or replace afternoon coffee with decaf or tea

**What to track:**
- Energy quality (less jittery, more stable?)
- Sleep quality (falling asleep easier, deeper sleep?)
- Pulse rate (should drop 5-10 bpm)
- Anxiety levels (should decrease)

**Expected results:**
- More stable energy (less spiky)
- Better sleep
- Lower pulse rate
- Less anxiety
- You may feel tired Days 1-3 (withdrawal), then energy stabilizes

**Why it works:** Excessive caffeine elevates cortisol and adrenaline, which can suppress thyroid long-term. Moderate caffeine is fine; excessive isn't.

**How to taper:**
- Week 1: Cut by 25%
- Week 2: Cut by 50%
- Gradual reduction prevents withdrawal headaches

---

### Experiment #10: Eliminate Gluten for 14 Days

**Difficulty:** Medium
**Duration:** 14 days
**Best for:** People with bloating, brain fog, digestive issues, fatigue

**What to do:**
Remove ALL gluten for 14 days:
- No wheat, barley, rye
- No bread, pasta, crackers, baked goods (unless gluten-free)
- Check labels (gluten hides in sauces, processed foods)

**What you CAN eat:**
- Rice, potatoes, corn, quinoa, oats (certified GF)
- All meat, fish, eggs, dairy
- All fruits and vegetables
- Gluten-free bread/pasta if desired

**What to track:**
- Bloating (should decrease if gluten is an issue)
- Brain fog (should clear)
- Energy (may improve)
- Digestion (bowel movements, gas)
- Joint pain (may decrease)

**Expected results IF gluten is a problem:**
- Major reduction in bloating
- Clearer thinking
- Better energy
- Improved digestion

**Expected results IF gluten is NOT a problem:**
- No significant change

**How to reintroduce (Day 15):**
- Eat a normal serving of bread
- Track for 24-48 hours
- Note any bloating, brain fog, fatigue, digestive issues

**Why it works:** Some people have celiac, gluten sensitivity, or wheat intolerance. Elimination reveals if gluten is problematic for YOU.

## HARD EXPERIMENTS (Advanced - Only After Mastering Basics)

### Experiment #11: 30-Day Strict PUFA Elimination

**Difficulty:** Hard
**Duration:** 30 days
**Best for:** Everyone serious about metabolic recovery

**What to do:**
ZERO seed oils for 30 days:
- No eating out (unless you can verify cooking fat)
- No packaged foods with seed oils
- Cook everything at home with butter, coconut oil, or tallow
- Read every label

**What to track:**
- Temperature (track weekly average)
- Energy (daily ratings)
- Digestion
- Sleep quality
- Mood
- Any inflammation markers (joint pain, skin issues)

**Expected results:**
- Temperature rises 0.5-1.5°F over 30 days
- Major energy improvement
- Reduced inflammation
- Better sleep
- Clearer skin
- Improved mood
- Weight may normalize

**Why it works:** PUFAs accumulate in tissues and take months/years to fully clear. 30 days shows dramatic improvements.

**This should become permanent.** After experiencing the benefits, you won't want to go back.

---

### Experiment #12: Reverse Diet (Increase Calories by 500)

**Difficulty:** Hard
**Duration:** 28 days
**Best for:** Chronic dieters, metabolic damage, very low temperature (<97°F)

**What to do:**
Increase calories by 500 daily (from baseline):
- Week 1: +200 calories
- Week 2: +300 calories
- Week 3: +400 calories
- Week 4: +500 calories

Add through carbs and fats (not just protein).

**What to track:**
- Temperature (should rise significantly)
- Weight (may increase initially, then stabilize)
- Energy (should improve dramatically)
- Hunger signals (should normalize)
- Mood and mental clarity

**Expected results:**
- Temperature rises 0.5-1.0°F
- Energy increases significantly
- Initial weight gain (2-5 lbs), then stabilizes
- Metabolism increases (you can eat more without gaining long-term)

**Why it works:** Years of dieting suppress metabolism. Reverse dieting gradually increases metabolic rate.

**Mental challenge:** You must trust the process. Initial weight gain is normal and temporary.

---

### Experiment #13: Eat Liver Weekly for 8 Weeks

**Difficulty:** Hard (if you hate liver)
**Duration:** 8 weeks
**Best for:** People with low vitamin A, copper, or overall nutrient deficiencies

**What to do:**
Eat 4 oz (115g) beef liver once per week for 8 weeks.

**How to make it tolerable:**
- Pan-fry with butter and onions
- Make pâté (blend with butter, cream, spices)
- Hide in ground beef (mix 1 part liver to 4 parts ground beef)
- Freeze into small pieces, swallow like pills (if you really hate it)

**What to track:**
- Energy (should improve)
- Skin quality (may improve)
- Hair and nails (may improve)
- Vision (especially night vision - may improve)
- Immunity (fewer colds?)
- Temperature (may rise slightly)

**Expected results:**
- Better energy
- Improved skin, hair, nails
- Better immunity
- Feeling of "vitality"

**Why it works:** Liver is the most nutrient-dense food on earth (vitamin A, copper, iron, B12, folate). Fills in nutritional gaps.

---

### Experiment #14: Eliminate All Alcohol for 30 Days

**Difficulty:** Hard (socially)
**Duration:** 30 days
**Best for:** Regular drinkers, people with poor sleep or low energy

**What to do:**
Zero alcohol for 30 days:
- No beer, wine, liquor
- Navigate social situations without drinking

**What to track:**
- Sleep quality (should improve dramatically)
- Energy (especially morning energy)
- Temperature (may rise)
- Mood stability (should improve)
- Digestion (may improve)
- Body composition (may improve)

**Expected results:**
- Much better sleep
- Higher energy (especially mornings)
- Improved mood
- Better digestion
- Potential weight loss
- Clearer thinking

**Why it works:** Alcohol disrupts sleep architecture, suppresses thyroid, increases cortisol, impairs digestion.

**Social strategies:**
- Order sparkling water with lime
- Say "I'm taking a break from alcohol"
- Find non-drinking social activities

---

### Experiment #15: Carnivore-ish Diet for 14 Days

**Difficulty:** Hard
**Duration:** 14 days
**Best for:** People with severe digestive issues, autoimmune conditions

**What to do:**
Eat ONLY:
- Meat (beef, lamb, pork, chicken, fish)
- Eggs
- Dairy (if tolerated - butter, cheese, milk)
- Salt

NO:
- Plants (vegetables, fruits, grains, nuts, seeds)
- Processed foods
- Seed oils (obviously)

**What to track:**
- Digestion (should improve significantly)
- Bloating (should disappear)
- Energy (may increase)
- Inflammation (joint pain, skin issues should improve)
- Bowel movements (may change - usually improve after adjustment)

**Expected results IF you have plant food sensitivities:**
- Digestion improves dramatically
- Bloating disappears
- Energy increases
- Inflammation reduces

**Expected results IF you don't have plant sensitivities:**
- You may feel fine but miss the variety

**How to reintroduce (Day 15):**
- Add back one plant food at a time
- Track response to each
- Identify which plants (if any) cause issues

**Why it works:** Removes all potential dietary triggers. If symptoms improve, you can systematically reintroduce to find problematic foods.

**Note:** This is an elimination diet, not necessarily long-term. Use it to identify issues, then reintroduce tolerated foods.

## ADVANCED EXPERIMENTS (For Fine-Tuning)

### Experiment #16: Meal Timing - Early Dinner (Before 6 PM)

**Difficulty:** Medium
**Duration:** 14 days
**Best for:** People with poor sleep or digestive issues

**What to do:**
Eat dinner by 6 PM, nothing after (except water or herbal tea).

Breakfast at 7-8 AM = ~13-hour overnight fast.

**What to track:**
- Sleep quality
- Morning hunger
- Digestion
- Energy upon waking
- Morning temperature

**Expected results:**
- Better sleep (less disruption from digestion)
- More natural hunger in morning
- Improved digestion
- Potentially better morning temp

**Why it works:** Gives digestion a long rest overnight, aligns with circadian rhythms.

---

### Experiment #17: Add Gelatin/Collagen Daily

**Difficulty:** Easy-Medium
**Duration:** 21 days
**Best for:** High meat eaters, gut issues, joint pain

**What to do:**
Add 10-20g gelatin or collagen peptides daily:
- In coffee or tea
- In smoothies
- Make jello or gummy snacks
- Homemade bone broth

**What to track:**
- Digestion (should improve)
- Joint pain (should decrease)
- Skin quality (may improve)
- Hair and nails (may improve)
- Sleep quality (may improve - glycine helps sleep)

**Expected results:**
- Better digestion
- Less joint pain
- Improved skin, hair, nails
- Better sleep

**Why it works:** Balances amino acids (most people get too much methionine from muscle meat, not enough glycine). Glycine supports gut healing, collagen formation, sleep.

---

### Experiment #18: Strategic Carb Timing (Post-Workout)

**Difficulty:** Medium
**Duration:** 14 days
**Best for:** Athletes, people who exercise regularly

**What to do:**
Eat your largest carb serving within 1-2 hours after exercise:
- Post-workout: 50-100g carbs (white rice, potatoes, fruit, honey)
- Other meals: Moderate carbs

**What to track:**
- Recovery speed
- Energy next day
- Performance in workouts
- Sleep quality
- Temperature response

**Expected results:**
- Better recovery
- More energy for next workout
- Improved performance
- Better glycogen replenishment

**Why it works:** Post-workout is when muscles are most insulin-sensitive. Carbs go to muscle glycogen, not fat storage.

---

### Experiment #19: Increase Salt Intake

**Difficulty:** Easy
**Duration:** 7 days
**Best for:** Low blood pressure, dizziness upon standing, low-carb dieters

**What to do:**
Add 1-2 tsp additional salt daily:
- Salt your food liberally
- Add pinch of salt to water or juice
- Use iodized salt (for iodine + sodium)

**What to track:**
- Blood pressure (if you can measure)
- Dizziness upon standing
- Energy levels
- Hydration status
- Temperature

**Expected results:**
- Less dizziness
- Better energy
- Improved hydration
- May help with temperature regulation

**Why it works:** Many people under-salt their food. Sodium is essential for hormone production, hydration, blood pressure, and adrenal function.

**Contraindication:** If you have high blood pressure, consult a doctor first.

---

### Experiment #20: Track Cycle (For Women)

**Difficulty:** Easy-Medium
**Duration:** 2+ months (minimum 2 full cycles)
**Best for:** Women with irregular cycles, PMS, hormonal issues

**What to do:**
Track temperature and symptoms throughout your menstrual cycle:
- Day 1 = first day of period
- Track temp, energy, mood, symptoms daily
- Note patterns across phases:
  - Follicular (Days 1-14): Estrogen rising
  - Ovulation (Day 14-16): Temp should spike 0.5°F
  - Luteal (Days 15-28): Progesterone high, temp elevated

**What to track:**
- Temperature (should rise after ovulation)
- Energy across phases
- PMS symptoms
- Period quality (heavy/light, painful/comfortable)
- Mood across cycle

**Expected results with good metabolic health:**
- Clear temp spike after ovulation
- Minimal PMS
- Regular 28-32 day cycle
- Comfortable periods

**What improvements in protocol should do:**
- As metabolism improves (from PUFA elimination, adequate carbs), cycles often regulate
- PMS decreases
- Temperature spike becomes more consistent

**Why it works:** Hormones affect metabolism, metabolism affects hormones. Tracking reveals patterns and improvements.

## How to Create Your Own Experiments

**Once you've done many of the above, you may want to test something specific to YOU.**

### Framework for Custom Experiments

<Steps>
  <Step title="Identify the Variable">
    What do you want to test?
    - A specific food
    - A timing strategy
    - A supplement
    - A lifestyle factor

    Example: "I want to test if eating rice at dinner improves my sleep"
  </Step>

  <Step title="Establish Baseline">
    Track signals for 3-7 days WITHOUT the change
  </Step>

  <Step title="Make ONE Change">
    Add or remove ONLY the variable you're testing

    Example: Add 1 cup white rice to dinner every night
  </Step>

  <Step title="Track for 7-14 Days">
    Continue tracking the same signals

    Look for changes in:
    - Temperature
    - Energy
    - Digestion
    - Sleep
    - Whatever your specific goal is
  </Step>

  <Step title="Compare and Decide">
    **Did signals improve?** → Keep the change
    **Did signals worsen?** → Reverse the change
    **No change?** → Try longer or try something else
  </Step>
</Steps>

## FAQs About Experimenting

### How long should I wait between experiments?

**Minimum 7 days of stable baseline** before starting a new experiment.

If you just finished an experiment and kept the change, wait 7 days to stabilize before testing something new.

---

### Can I run multiple experiments at once?

**No.** You won't know which variable caused the change.

**Exception:** If experiments are testing completely different body systems (e.g., adding carbs for energy + eliminating dairy for skin), you *might* be able to track both. But generally, one at a time is best.

---

### What if my signals get worse during an experiment?

**Stop immediately.** Don't force yourself through 14 days if you feel terrible after 3 days.

Reverse the change, return to baseline, try something different.

---

### What if I see no change after an experiment?

**Three possibilities:**
1. **You need more time** - Some changes take weeks (e.g., vitamin deficiency corrections)
2. **This variable doesn't matter for you** - Not every experiment works for everyone
3. **Other factors are masking the effect** - Stress, sleep, hidden PUFAs might be bigger issues

---

### Do I have to do all 20 experiments?

**No.** Do the ones that are relevant to YOUR symptoms and goals.

**Must-do experiments:**
- #4: Replace seed oils with butter/coconut oil (everyone)
- #11: 30-day strict PUFA elimination (everyone)
- #1: Add strategic carbs (if low-carb)
- #3: Increase calories (if under-eating)

The rest are optional based on your needs.

---

## The Bottom Line

<Note>
**You are the scientist. Your body is the lab.**

**Experiments reveal what works for YOU:**
- Not what works for influencers
- Not what worked for your friend
- Not what a study said
- **What YOUR body responds to**

**The most important experiments:**
1. Eliminate PUFAs completely
2. Add adequate carbs (if low-carb)
3. Eat enough calories (if restricting)
4. Track your signals consistently

**Everything else is fine-tuning.**

**Trust your body's feedback over any dogma.**
