## The Simple Rule

Not all "sugar" is created equal. The difference isn't the chemical structure—it's the **source, processing, and what it comes with**.

<Info>
**The Golden Rule:**

✅ **Good:** Whole food sources with nutrients, minerals, and enzymes
❌ **Bad:** Processed sources stripped of nutrition, usually combined with PUFAs
</Info>

## Good Sugar Sources

### Fruit (⭐⭐⭐ Excellent)

**Why it's good:**
- Comes with fiber (slows absorption)
- Rich in vitamins, minerals, potassium
- Contains enzymes that help digestion
- Natural fructose in balance with glucose

**Best choices:**
- Oranges (vitamin C, potassium)
- Bananas (potassium, easily digestible)
- Melons (hydrating, mineral-rich)
- Berries (antioxidants, lower sugar)
- Grapes (quick energy, minerals)
- Apples, pears (fiber, satisfying)

**How to use:**
- Fresh, ripe fruit (not dried or processed)
- Morning or around activity
- Pair with protein for satiety

---

### Orange Juice (⭐⭐⭐ Excellent)

**Why it's good:**
- Easy to digest (no fiber to slow down)
- High in vitamin C, potassium, folate
- Quick glucose for brain and thyroid
- Ray Peat's favorite carb source

**Best practices:**
- Fresh-squeezed if possible
- Store-bought: check for "100% juice, no added sugar"
- Avoid: "orange drink," "orange beverage" (these have HFCS + additives)

**When to use:**
- First thing in the morning (gentle on digestion)
- Post-workout (quick glycogen replenishment)
- Mid-afternoon energy boost

---

### Honey (⭐⭐⭐ Excellent)

**Why it's good:**
- Contains enzymes, minerals, trace nutrients
- Antimicrobial properties
- Balanced glucose/fructose ratio
- Supports gut health

**Best choices:**
- Raw, unfiltered honey (retains enzymes)
- Local honey (bonus: helps with allergies)
- Avoid: "honey blend" or processed honey

**How to use:**
- In coffee or tea
- Drizzled on yogurt or oatmeal
- Straight off the spoon for quick energy

---

### White Rice (⭐⭐ Good)

**Why it's good:**
- Easily digestible starch (low antinutrients)
- Well-tolerated by most people
- Provides steady glucose
- Traditional staple in healthy cultures

**Best practices:**
- Cook in bone broth or salted water (adds minerals)
- Pair with butter or coconut oil (slows digestion, adds satiety)
- Jasmine, basmati, sushi rice all work

**When to use:**
- Main meals (lunch, dinner)
- After exercise (restores glycogen)
- When you need sustained energy

---

### Potatoes (⭐⭐ Good)

**Why they're good:**
- High in potassium (more than bananas)
- Vitamin C, B vitamins
- Satisfying and filling
- Easy to digest when well-cooked

**Best choices:**
- White potatoes (lower in antinutrients than sweet potatoes)
- Peeled (removes most of the problematic compounds)
- Well-cooked (soft, not resistant starch)

**How to prepare:**
- Baked with butter and salt
- Mashed with butter/milk
- Boiled and seasoned
- Avoid: fried in seed oils

---

### Sourdough Bread (⭐ Moderate)

**Why it's better than regular bread:**
- Fermentation breaks down gluten and phytic acid
- Easier to digest
- Lower antinutrients than whole wheat

**Best practices:**
- True sourdough (long fermentation, no commercial yeast)
- Check ingredients: flour, water, salt, starter (that's it)
- Avoid: bread with soybean oil, preservatives

**When to use:**
- Toast with butter and honey
- Occasional, not daily staple
- If well-tolerated

---

### White Sugar / Table Sugar (⭐ Neutral)

**Why it's neutral (not bad, not great):**
- Pure sucrose (50% glucose, 50% fructose)
- No nutrients, but no toxins either
- Better than artificial sweeteners
- Better than HFCS

**When to use:**
- In coffee or tea (if you prefer it to honey)
- Baking (when honey doesn't work)
- Small amounts for flavor

**Note:** Not "bad" like conventional wisdom says, but not nutrient-dense either. Use strategically.

---

## Bad Sugar Sources

### High Fructose Corn Syrup (❌ Avoid)

**Why it's bad:**
- Imbalanced ratio (55% fructose, 45% glucose)
- Highly processed
- Usually combined with seed oils
- In EVERY processed food

**Where it hides:**
- Soda
- Candy
- Packaged snacks
- "Low-fat" products
- Condiments (ketchup, BBQ sauce)
- Bread, crackers

**Why it's different from table sugar:**
- Higher fructose percentage overwhelms liver
- No nutrients whatsoever
- Always paired with other junk (PUFAs, additives)

---

### Agave Nectar (❌ Avoid)

**Why it's bad:**
- 90% fructose (even worse than HFCS)
- Marketed as "healthy" but it's not
- Processed, stripped of nutrients
- Harder on liver than table sugar

**Bottom line:** Agave is worse than table sugar. Use honey instead.

---

### Artificial Sweeteners (❌❌ Definitely Avoid)

**Why they're terrible:**
- Aspartame, sucralose, saccharin → neurotoxic
- Disrupt gut bacteria
- Increase cravings for sweet foods
- Confuse metabolic signals (sweet taste, no calories → insulin confusion)

**Includes:**
- Diet soda
- "Sugar-free" products
- Protein bars with sucralose
- "Zero calorie" sweeteners

**Better option:** If you want sweet, use real sugar or honey. Your body knows what to do with real food.

---

### Processed Baked Goods (❌ Avoid)

**Why they're bad:**
- Combination of HFCS + seed oils (metabolic disaster)
- Refined flour (stripped of nutrients)
- Artificial preservatives, additives

**Includes:**
- Packaged cookies, cakes, muffins
- Donuts (deep fried in seed oil)
- Pastries from chain stores

**Better option:** Homemade baked goods with butter, honey, and real ingredients

## The Nuance: Fructose Isn't Evil

**Here's what they got wrong:**

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="The Fear">
    "Fructose is processed by the liver and causes fatty liver disease!"

    **This is oversimplified.**
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="The Truth">
    **Fructose in context:**
    - In fruit: Fine (comes with fiber, vitamins, minerals)
    - In honey: Fine (balanced with glucose, has enzymes)
    - In table sugar: Neutral (50/50 ratio, your body handles it)
    - In HFCS: Problematic (90%+ fructose, no nutrients, combined with PUFAs)

    **The dose makes the poison.** 25g fructose from fruit? No problem. 100g fructose from soda and candy? Liver overload.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="The Real Issue">
    **Fructose becomes a problem when:**
    - Consumed in excess (>50g/day from processed sources)
    - Combined with PUFAs (blocks metabolism)
    - In isolation (HFCS without glucose balance)
    - Your liver is already damaged (from PUFAs, alcohol, etc.)

    **Fix the root cause** (eliminate PUFAs), and fructose from whole foods is fine.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Quick Reference Chart

| Food | Rating | Why | When to Use |
|------|--------|-----|-------------|
| **Fruit** | ⭐⭐⭐ | Nutrients, enzymes, fiber | Anytime, especially morning |
| **Orange Juice** | ⭐⭐⭐ | Easy digestion, vitamins | Morning, post-workout |
| **Honey** | ⭐⭐⭐ | Enzymes, minerals, balanced | Coffee/tea, quick energy |
| **White Rice** | ⭐⭐ | Digestible starch, well-tolerated | Main meals |
| **Potatoes** | ⭐⭐ | Potassium, satisfying | Main meals |
| **Sourdough** | ⭐ | Fermented, easier to digest | Occasional |
| **Table Sugar** | ⭐ | Neutral, no toxins | Small amounts for flavor |
| **HFCS** | ❌ | Imbalanced, processed, with PUFAs | Never |
| **Agave** | ❌ | 90% fructose, processed | Never |
| **Artificial Sweeteners** | ❌❌ | Neurotoxic, metabolic disruption | Never |

## The Bottom Line

<Note>
**Choose carbs based on:**

1. **Nutrient density** - Does it come with vitamins, minerals, enzymes?
2. **Processing** - Is it whole food or factory-made?
3. **What it's paired with** - Does it come with PUFAs? (If yes, avoid)

**Good carbs support metabolism. Bad carbs (especially with PUFAs) destroy it.**

Eat fruit, drink OJ, use honey. Your body knows what to do with real food.
