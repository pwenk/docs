# Module 4: Reading Your Body (The Signals That Matter)

**Time to Complete:** 45 minutes

**Priority:** MOST IMPORTANT ⭐⭐⭐

## What You'll Learn

- Body temperature tracking (the master signal)
- Pulse rate interpretation
- Energy levels throughout the day
- Digestion signals
- How you FEEL when you eat specific foods

## Why Body Signals Matter

Most diets tell you what to eat based on studies of other people.

**This course is different:** You learn what YOUR body needs by tracking what it tells you.

Your body is always communicating. You just need to learn its language.

## The Master Signal: Body Temperature

**Your body temperature reveals metabolism health.**

<Info>
  A healthy metabolism maintains 97.8-98.6°F throughout the day.

  Lower temps = slower metabolism (often from PUFAs, low thyroid, or stress)
</Info>

### How to Track Temperature

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get a Digital Thermometer">
    Any basic digital oral thermometer works ($10-15).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Track 3x Per Day">
    - Morning (upon waking, before getting up)
    - Mid-day (around 2-3 PM, peak metabolic time)
    - Evening (around 6-7 PM)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Record the Numbers">
    Use the Body Signal Tracking Sheet to log temps daily.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Look for Patterns">
    After 7 days, review:
    - Is your temp rising or falling?
    - How does it correlate with food choices?
    - What makes it spike or drop?
  </Step>
</Steps>

### What Different Temps Mean

| Temperature Range | What It Means |
|-------------------|---------------|
| 98.0-98.6°F | Healthy metabolism, good thyroid function |
| 97.5-97.9°F | Mild metabolic slowdown, room for improvement |
| 97.0-97.4°F | Significant metabolic issues, thyroid likely suppressed |
| Below 97.0°F | Severe metabolic suppression, needs immediate attention |

**Goal:** Get your average daily temp to 98.0°F or higher

## Signal #2: Pulse Rate

Your resting pulse rate is another metabolic indicator.

### How to Track Pulse

<Steps>
  <Step title="Find Your Pulse">
    Two fingers on your wrist or neck, count beats for 15 seconds, multiply by 4.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Track at Rest">
    - Morning (before getting out of bed)
    - Throughout the day (when calm, not after activity)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Record the Number">
    Log it alongside temperature.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Ideal Pulse Range

| Pulse Rate | What It Means |
|------------|---------------|
| 75-85 bpm | Healthy metabolism |
| 65-74 bpm | Possible metabolic slowdown |
| Below 65 bpm | Often indicates stress compensation or low thyroid |
| Above 85 bpm | May indicate stress, caffeine, or thyroid issue |

**Note:** Athletes may have lower resting pulse from conditioning. Context matters.

## Signal #3: Energy Levels

Track your energy throughout the day on a 1-10 scale.

### What to Notice

**Healthy Energy Pattern:**
- Wake up naturally (no alarm needed)
- Energy builds through morning
- Stable energy after meals (no crashes)
- Natural wind-down in evening

**Problematic Patterns:**
- Need coffee to function
- 2-3 PM crash
- Energy spikes and crashes
- Wired at night, exhausted in morning

### Energy Tracking Questions

Rate yourself 1-10 for:
- **Morning:** How easy was it to wake up?
- **Mid-morning:** Energy level before lunch
- **After lunch:** Any crash or sustained energy?
- **Afternoon:** 2-3 PM energy check
- **Evening:** Natural tiredness or wired/exhausted?

## Signal #4: Digestion

Your gut tells you a lot about how food is working for you.

### What to Track

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="After Eating">
    **Immediately after meals, notice:**
    - Bloating or comfortable?
    - Gassy or settled?
    - Satisfied or still hungry?
    - Sleepy or energized?

    **Healthy response:**
    Comfortable, satisfied, slightly energized
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Bowel Movements">
    **Daily patterns:**
    - Frequency (1-3x per day is normal)
    - Consistency (formed, easy to pass)
    - Urgency (regular or rushed/delayed?)

    **Healthy digestion:**
    Regular, comfortable, 1-2x daily
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Problem Signs">
    **Watch for:**
    - Constipation (less than 1x daily)
    - Diarrhea (unformed, frequent)
    - Bloating after specific foods
    - Acid reflux
    - Nausea

    These suggest food intolerances or gut issues
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Signal #5: How You FEEL

Beyond numbers, pay attention to qualitative feelings.

### Daily Check-Ins

Ask yourself:

**Physical:**
- Warm hands and feet (or cold)?
- Dry skin/hair (or supple)?
- Joint pain or aches?
- Sleep quality (deep or restless)?

**Mental:**
- Mental clarity (sharp or foggy)?
- Mood stability (calm or anxious/irritable)?
- Stress response (resilient or easily overwhelmed)?
- Focus (sustained or scattered)?

**Hormonal:**
- Libido (present or absent)?
- For women: Regular periods, PMS severity
- For men: Morning wood, energy consistency

## The Body Signal Tracking Sheet

We've created a simple daily tracker for all these signals.

**Each day, log:**
- 3x body temperatures
- 2x pulse rates
- Energy ratings (morning, afternoon, evening)
- Digestion notes
- How you feel overall

**After 7 days, patterns emerge.**

## How to Use This Data

### Week 1: Baseline

Track everything without changing your diet. This shows where you're starting.

### Week 2+: Experiment & Track

As you make changes (eliminating PUFAs, adding strategic carbs), watch how your signals respond.

**Questions to ask:**
- Did my temp rise after eliminating seed oils?
- Do I have more energy when I eat rice vs when I skip carbs?
- Which foods make me bloated vs comfortable?

**Your body will tell you what works.**

## Common Patterns

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Low temp + low pulse + low energy">
    **Classic hypothyroid pattern**

    Often from:
    - PUFA accumulation
    - Low carb diet
    - Chronic stress

    **Fix:** Eliminate PUFAs, add strategic glucose, reduce stress
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Normal temp + high pulse + anxious energy">
    **Stress response pattern**

    Often from:
    - Too much caffeine
    - Undereating
    - High stress lifestyle

    **Fix:** Eat more (especially carbs), reduce stimulants, manage stress
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Temp varies wildly + energy crashes">
    **Blood sugar instability**

    Often from:
    - Skipping meals
    - High PUFA intake
    - Damaged metabolism

    **Fix:** Eat regular meals with carbs, eliminate PUFAs, stabilize schedule
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Your Assignment

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get Your Tools">
    - Digital oral thermometer
    - Way to track pulse (or use phone app)
    - Print or download the tracking sheet
  </Step>

  <Step title="Track for 7 Days">
    Start now. Track baseline before making changes.

    Log:
    - Temperature (3x daily)
    - Pulse (2x daily)
    - Energy (throughout day)
    - Digestion
    - How you feel
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review Your Patterns">
    After 7 days, look for:
    - Average temperature
    - Temperature trends
    - Energy patterns
    - Food-feeling correlations
  </Step>

  <Step title="Identify Your Starting Point">
    Based on your signals, where are you?
    - Healthy metabolism?
    - Mild suppression?
    - Significant metabolic issues?

    This determines your experiment strategy.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this module, you should be able to:

✓ Track body temperature and pulse accurately
✓ Notice energy patterns throughout the day
✓ Identify digestion signals after eating
✓ Develop daily body awareness practice
✓ Correlate food choices with how you feel

## The Practice

<Note>
  **This isn't something you do once and forget.**

  Body awareness is a daily practice. The more you track, the better you get at hearing what your body needs.

  Over time, you won't need to write everything down. You'll just know.
</Note>

## What's Next?

In **Module 5**, you'll put this tracking to use as you eliminate PUFAs from your diet. This is where the real transformation begins.
