description: 'The 7-day plan to remove seed oils and restock your kitchen'
---

**Time to Complete:** 1 hour (+ 7 days of implementation)

**Priority:** MOST IMPORTANT ⭐⭐⭐

<Warning>
  This is THE most impactful action you'll take in this entire course. Everything else becomes easier once PUFAs are eliminated.
</Warning>

## What You'll Learn

- The 7-day PUFA purge plan
- Kitchen cleanout strategy (what to throw out)
- PUFA-free shopping list
- Restaurant survival guide
- Social situation navigation

## The 7-Day PUFA Purge

Your goal: **Eliminate 90% of PUFAs in one week.**

Not 100% (that's impossible unless you never eat out). But 90% will transform your metabolism.

### Day 1: The Kitchen Audit

<Steps>
  <Step title="Pull Everything Out">
    Remove all foods from pantry, fridge, freezer.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Read Every Label">
    Check ingredient lists for:
    - Vegetable oil
    - Canola oil
    - Soybean oil
    - Sunflower oil
    - Safflower oil
    - Corn oil
    - Cottonseed oil
    - Grapeseed oil
    - Rice bran oil
    - "Partially hydrogenated" anything
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create Two Piles">
    **PUFA Pile:** Anything with seed oils
    **Safe Pile:** PUFA-free foods
  </Step>

  <Step title="Throw Out or Donate the PUFA Pile">
    Yes, all of it. Don't "use it up" - that's just prolonging the damage.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Days 2-3: Restock Your Kitchen

Now fill your kitchen with PUFA-free staples.

### Days 6-7: Navigate the Outside World

This is where it gets tricky. Restaurants use seed oils everywhere.

## Restaurant Survival Guide

### The Safest Restaurant Types

<Steps>
  <Step title="1. Steakhouses">
    **Why:** They typically cook in butter or tallow

    **Order:** Steak (ask for butter on top, not oil), baked potato with butter and sour cream, simple salad with olive oil/vinegar on side
  </Step>

  <Step title="2. Mexican (Authentic)">
    **Why:** Traditional Mexican cooking uses lard

    **Order:** Tacos with corn tortillas, rice, beans (ask if they use lard - many authentic places do). Avoid chips unless fried in lard.
  </Step>

  <Step title="3. Asian (with caution)">
    **Why:** Some use traditional fats, but most modern places use seed oils

    **Ask:** "Do you cook with vegetable oil or peanut oil?" If peanut oil, okay. If vegetable/soybean, skip or order steamed dishes.

    **Safe orders:** Steamed rice, steamed vegetables, meat dishes you can request "no oil"
  </Step>

  <Step title="4. Italian">
    **Why:** Olive oil-based cuisine (when authentic)

    **Order:** Pasta with simple olive oil-based sauces, avoid fried items

    **Ask:** About bread - some Italian restaurants use real olive oil
  </Step>
</Steps>

### The Restaurant Scripts

**When ordering:**

<CodeGroup>

```text Script 1: Direct
"I have a severe allergy to seed oils and vegetable oils.
Can you cook my [order] in butter or olive oil instead?"

Most restaurants will accommodate allergies.
```

```text Script 2: Simple Request
"Can you prepare this with butter instead of vegetable oil?"

Short and to the point.
```

```text Script 3: Skip the Why
"I'd like the steak cooked in butter, please."

Just request what you want without explanation.
```

</CodeGroup>

**Pro tip:** Calling ahead helps. "Hi, I have dietary restrictions. Do you cook with butter or vegetable oils?"

### The 90/10 Rule

<Info>
  **Don't let perfect be the enemy of good.**

  You will occasionally eat seed oils when dining out. That's okay. Focus on:
  - Eliminating them at home (100%)
  - Minimizing them when eating out (80-90%)
  - Not stressing about unavoidable exposure

  Stress does more damage than occasional PUFA exposure.
</Info>

## Social Situations

### Handling Questions

People will ask why you're "being difficult" about food.

**What to say:**

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Short Version">
    "I'm avoiding certain oils that don't agree with me."

    No lecture needed.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Health Version">
    "I'm working on some health issues and cutting out processed oils has really helped."

    True and hard to argue with.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="If They Push">
    "I'd love to tell you more about it, but not here. Let's grab coffee sometime!"

    Deflects without being rude.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="The Truth (if they're genuinely curious)">
    "I've been learning about how seed oils damage metabolism, and since cutting them out, my [energy/weight/mood/temperature] has improved dramatically."

    Then pause. Let them ask more if interested.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

**Rule:** Don't preach. Just do your thing and let results speak.

## Tracking Your PUFA Elimination

Use your **Body Signal Tracking Sheet** from Module 4 to monitor changes.

### What to Watch For

**Week 1-2:**
- Minimal changes (PUFAs take time to clear)
- Possibly feel worse (detox symptoms)

**Week 3-4:**
- Energy stabilizes
- Temperature begins rising
- Digestion improves
- Less bloating

**Week 6-8:**
- Noticeable temperature increase
- Consistent energy
- Weight shifts (may lose or gain as metabolism normalizes)
- Mental clarity improves

**Month 3+:**
- Significant metabolic improvements
- Can tolerate carbs better
- Hormones rebalancing
- True metabolic healing

## Common Challenges

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="'It's too expensive'">
    Real food costs more than processed food. Yes.

    But consider:
    - You'll eat less (more satisfied with nutrient-dense food)
    - Medical costs from metabolic disease far exceed food costs
    - Your health is worth it

    **Budget tips:**
    - Buy butter in bulk
    - Ground beef instead of steak
    - Eggs are cheap protein
    - White rice is inexpensive
    - Skip organic if cost-prohibitive (focus on PUFA elimination first)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="'My family won't eat this way'">
    You don't need to force them.

    **Strategy:**
    - Cook PUFA-free meals (they won't notice)
    - Let them add seed oil-based condiments if they want
    - Focus on your own plate
    - Lead by example (your results will speak)

    Most families happily eat butter, meat, potatoes, and vegetables.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="'I ate PUFAs by accident - did I ruin everything?'">
    No. Relax.

    One meal with seed oils won't undo weeks of good choices.

    **What to do:**
    - Notice how you feel (energy crash? Bloating?)
    - Return to PUFA-free eating next meal
    - Don't stress about it (stress is worse than occasional PUFAs)

    This is a practice, not perfection.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="'I'm traveling/on vacation'">
    Do your best:
    - Pack snacks (cheese, fruit, dark chocolate)
    - Choose better restaurants (steakhouses over fast food)
    - Order simple foods (less likely to have hidden seed oils)
    - Don't stress - vacation is temporary

    Return to 90% compliance when you're home.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
