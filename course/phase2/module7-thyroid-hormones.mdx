## The Thyroid: Your Metabolic Master Switch

Think of your thyroid as the thermostat for your entire body.

**It regulates:**
- Body temperature
- Energy production
- Heart rate
- Digestion speed
- Brain function
- Sex hormone production
- Weight
- Hair growth
- Skin health

**When thyroid is working:** You feel warm, energized, sharp, and balanced.

**When thyroid is suppressed:** You feel cold, tired, foggy, and off.

## The Thyroid Hormones (Simplified)

You don't need to memorize this, but it's helpful context.

### The Basics

<Steps>
  <Step title="TSH (Thyroid Stimulating Hormone)">
    Made by your pituitary gland. Tells thyroid to produce hormones.

    **High TSH** = Your body is screaming for more thyroid hormone (thyroid struggling)

    **Low TSH** = Body thinks it has enough (or has given up)
  </Step>

  <Step title="T4 (Storage Hormone)">
    Made by thyroid. Inactive form. Gets converted to T3.

    Most people have enough T4. Conversion is the problem.
  </Step>

  <Step title="T3 (Active Hormone)">
    The one that actually works. Converted from T4 in liver, gut, and other tissues.

    **This is what matters.**

    Low T3 = low metabolism, low energy, low temp
  </Step>

  <Step title="Reverse T3 (rT3)">
    Inactive form. Body makes this when stressed or starving.

    Blocks T3 from working (metabolic brake).

    **High rT3 = your body is in conservation mode**
  </Step>
</Steps>

### The Key Insight

**Your body can have plenty of T4 but still have low metabolism if:**
- T4 isn't converting to T3
- rT3 is elevated (blocking T3)
- PUFAs are damaging cells
- You're undereating or over-stressing

**This is why people say "My thyroid tests are normal but I still feel terrible."**

Standard tests only check TSH and T4. They miss T3 and rT3.

## What Thyroid Needs to Function

Your thyroid is NOT fragile. But it needs the right inputs.

### Essential Nutrients for Thyroid

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Glucose">
    **Why:**
    - Converts T4 to T3
    - Supports liver function (where conversion happens)
    - Signals "we have food, it's safe to have a metabolism"

    **Without enough:**
    - T4 can't convert to T3
    - rT3 increases (metabolic brake)
    - Body thinks you're starving

    **How much:**
    Minimum 150g carbs/day for most people (more for active individuals)
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Selenium">
    **Why:**
    - Required for T4 to T3 conversion
    - Protects thyroid from oxidative damage

    **Sources:**
    - Brazil nuts (2-3 per day)
    - Seafood
    - Organ meats
    - Eggs

    **How much:**
    200mcg/day
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Iodine">
    **Why:**
    - Thyroid hormones are made from iodine + tyrosine

    **Sources:**
    - Iodized salt
    - Seafood
    - Seaweed
    - Dairy

    **How much:**
    150-300mcg/day

    **Warning:** Too much iodine can worsen autoimmune thyroid issues. Moderation.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Zinc & Copper">
    **Why:**
    - Support T4 to T3 conversion
    - Regulate enzyme function

    **Sources:**
    - Zinc: Red meat, oysters, pumpkin seeds
    - Copper: Liver, shellfish, nuts

    **How much:**
    - Zinc: 15-30mg/day
    - Copper: 1-2mg/day

    Balance matters (too much zinc depletes copper)
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Vitamin A (Retinol)">
    **Why:**
    - Supports thyroid hormone receptor sensitivity

    **Sources:**
    - Liver (best source)
    - Egg yolks
    - Butter
    - Cod liver oil

    **How much:**
    10,000-20,000 IU/day (from food)

    **Note:** Beta-carotene (from plants) is NOT the same
  </Tab>

## Why Low-Carb Destroys Thyroid

This is critical to understand.

### The Low-Carb Thyroid Cascade

<CodeGroup>

```text Phase 1: Initial Response (Weeks 1-4)
No carbs coming in
↓
Body produces cortisol and adrenaline (stress hormones)
↓
Mobilizes stored energy (glycogen, then fat)
↓
Weight loss, high energy (stress-driven)
↓
"This is working!"
```

```text Phase 2: Adaptation (Months 2-6)
Chronic low glucose
↓
Body perceives starvation
↓
T4 converts to reverse T3 (rT3) instead of active T3
↓
Metabolism slows (protective response)
↓
Lower body temp, energy crashes, weight loss stalls
```

```text Phase 3: Metabolic Damage (6+ months)
Prolonged thyroid suppression
↓
Lower metabolism, lower temp
↓
Hormonal issues (low sex hormones, mood problems)
↓
Weight regain (even on low calories)
↓
Can't tolerate carbs anymore (broken metabolism)
```

</CodeGroup>

### Why This Happens

**Your body thinks you're starving.**

In evolutionary terms, low glucose = famine. The body's response:
- Slow metabolism (conserve energy)
- Lower temperature (use less fuel)
- Reduce sex hormones (not safe to reproduce)
- Increase stress hormones (mobilize stored energy)

**Low-carb is a stress state.**

Short-term: manageable
Long-term: damaging

## Thyroid and Sex Hormones

Thyroid and sex hormones are connected.

### For Women

**Healthy thyroid:**
- Regular menstrual cycles
- Minimal PMS
- Healthy libido
- Stable mood
- Fertile

**Suppressed thyroid:**
- Irregular or missing periods
- Severe PMS
- Low libido
- Mood swings, anxiety, depression
- Difficulty conceiving

### For Men

**Healthy thyroid:**
- High testosterone
- Strong libido
- Consistent energy
- Lean muscle mass
- Mental clarity

**Suppressed thyroid:**
- Lower testosterone
- Low libido
- Fatigue
- Weight gain (especially belly)
- Brain fog

### Why They're Connected

Sex hormone production depends on:
- Cholesterol (precursor)
- Thyroid function (regulates production)
- Liver function (metabolizes hormones)
- Glucose (energy for the process)

**Low thyroid = low sex hormones**

## Thyroid and Mood/Cognition

Your brain is a thyroid-dependent organ.

### Thyroid's Role in the Brain

**Healthy thyroid:**
- Clear thinking
- Good memory
- Stable mood
- Resilience to stress
- Deep sleep

**Suppressed thyroid:**
- Brain fog
- Memory issues
- Depression, anxiety
- Easily overwhelmed
- Poor sleep

## How PUFAs Damage Thyroid

PUFAs interfere with thyroid at multiple levels:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Block Thyroid Hormone Production">
    PUFAs inhibit the enzymes that make T4 and T3
  </Step>

  <Step title="Block Conversion (T4 to T3)">
    Oxidized PUFAs damage liver cells where conversion happens
  </Step>

  <Step title="Block Thyroid Receptors">
    PUFAs in cell membranes prevent T3 from binding to receptors
  </Step>

  <Step title="Increase Inflammation">
    Oxidized PUFAs trigger inflammatory response, which suppresses thyroid
  </Step>

  <Step title="Raise Reverse T3">
    PUFAs stress the body, increasing rT3 (metabolic brake)
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Result:** Even if you have normal TSH/T4, your cells can't use thyroid hormone properly.

## Signs of Suppressed Thyroid

You don't need a blood test to suspect thyroid issues.

**Check these signals:**

<Accordion title="Temperature">
  Average daily temp below 97.8°F (especially morning temp below 97.5°F)
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Energy">
  Chronic fatigue, need caffeine to function, afternoon crashes
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Digestion">
  Constipation, slow digestion, bloating
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Mood">
  Depression, anxiety, brain fog, poor memory
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Hormones">
  Women: irregular periods, PMS, low libido
  Men: low libido, low testosterone symptoms
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Weight">
  Weight gain despite eating less, can't lose weight on low calories
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Hair/Skin">
  Hair loss, dry skin, brittle nails, thinning eyebrows (especially outer third)
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Heart Rate">
  Resting pulse below 65 bpm (in non-athletes)
</Accordion>

**If you have 3+ of these, thyroid is likely suppressed.**

## When to Test Thyroid

**Most people don't need thyroid tests to start.**

Your body signals tell you enough.

**But if you want to test (or suspect severe issues), ask for:**
- TSH
- Free T4
- Free T3
- Reverse T3
- Thyroid antibodies (TPO, TG) if autoimmune suspected

**Standard "TSH-only" test is worthless.** It misses most thyroid dysfunction.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this module, you should:

✓ Understand thyroid's role in metabolism (without becoming an expert)
✓ Know why low-carb suppresses thyroid function
✓ Recognize signs of thyroid suppression
✓ Connect thyroid function to sex hormones and mood

## The Bottom Line

<Note>
  **Your thyroid is not broken. It's suppressed.**

  From:
  - PUFAs blocking its function
  - Low carbs signaling starvation
  - Chronic stress raising rT3

  Fix those, and thyroid function often restores naturally.

  No medication needed for most people.
</Note>
