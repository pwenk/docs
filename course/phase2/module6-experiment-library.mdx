# Module 6: The Experiment Library (Lego Blocks)

**Time to Complete:** 1 hour

**Priority:** MOST IMPORTANT ⭐⭐⭐

## What You'll Learn

- 20 pre-designed experiments to run
- Each experiment: what to do, what to track, expected effects
- Difficulty ratings for each
- How to design your own experiments

## The Philosophy

**You are not following a diet. You are running experiments.**

Each experiment helps you understand how YOUR body responds to different foods, timing, and combinations.

## How to Use the Experiment Library

<Steps>
  <Step title="Choose an Experiment">
    Pick based on your current goals and experience level
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run It for the Specified Duration">
    Usually 3-14 days
  </Step>

  <Step title="Track Your Body Signals">
    Temperature, pulse, energy, digestion, how you feel
  </Step>

  <Step title="Analyze Results">
    Did your signals improve, stay the same, or worsen?
  </Step>

  <Step title="Decide: Keep, Modify, or Discard">
    If it works, incorporate it. If not, try something else.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Designing Your Own Experiments

Once you've run several experiments, you can design custom ones.

### The Framework

<Steps>
  <Step title="Ask a Specific Question">
    "Does eating eggs for breakfast give me more energy than yogurt?"
  </Step>

  <Step title="Change ONE Variable">
    Keep everything else the same
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set a Duration">
    Usually 3-14 days
  </Step>

  <Step title="Define What You'll Track">
    Temperature, energy, digestion, mood, etc.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Analyze and Decide">
    Did it help, hurt, or do nothing?
  </Step>
</Steps>

## The Experiment Tracker

We've created a template to log your experiments.

**For each experiment, record:**
- Name of experiment
- Start and end dates
- What you're testing
- Body signals before and after
- Conclusion (keep, modify, discard)

<Card title="Download: Experiment Tracker Template" icon="flask" href="#">
  Log and analyze your experiments
</Card>

## Your Assignment

<Steps>
  <Step title="Choose Your First Experiment">
    Pick an EASY experiment to start (1, 2, or 3)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run It for the Full Duration">
    Don't stop early
  </Step>

  <Step title="Track Your Signals Daily">
    Use the Body Signal Tracking Sheet
  </Step>

  <Step title="Analyze Results">
    After completion, compare before and after

    Questions:
    - Did temperature change?
    - Did energy improve?
    - How did digestion respond?
    - Do I want to keep this?
  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose Next Experiment">
    Based on results, pick another experiment or modify the current one
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this module, you should be able to:

✓ Choose appropriate experiments based on experience level
✓ Run structured experiments with tracking
✓ Analyze results using body signals
✓ Design custom experiments for personal goals

## The Practice

<Note>
  **The magic is in the experimentation.**

  Not following rules. Not obeying dogma. Testing and learning.

  Over 8 weeks, run 4-6 experiments. That's enough to build a personalized protocol that works for YOU.
</Note>

## What's Next?

In **Module 7**, you'll learn just enough about thyroid and hormones to understand why these experiments work (or don't).
