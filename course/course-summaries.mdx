  <Tab title="Phase 1: Foundation">

## Module 1: Take Stock + Why Everything You Know Is Wrong

**Duration:** 30 minutes | **Priority:** ⭐⭐

### The Bottom Line
Most nutrition advice is fundamentally wrong (the low-fat diet caused the obesity epidemic). Your first step is observing your current state without judgment. The sugar/obesity data shows sugar consumption DECREASED while obesity SKYROCKETED—proving sugar isn't the villain.

### Action Items
- Complete 3-day Food & Feeling Journal using the [Daily Tracking Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ux123WIVtTadMS_IGJbp7guxJxYkOfKY8knZZbxJO-g/edit?gid=0#gid=0)
- Document all nutrition beliefs you currently hold ("Everything I Thought I Knew" worksheet)
- Shift mindset from "I know" to "I'm experimenting"
- Track: what you eat, when you eat, how you feel after, body signals (temperature, sleep, energy, digestion)

---

## Module 2: The PUFA Problem (The Real Enemy)

**Duration:** 45 minutes | **Priority:** ⭐⭐⭐ MOST IMPORTANT

### The Bottom Line
Seed oils (PUFAs) are the real problem, not sugar. They oxidize inside your body and destroy thyroid function, energy, and metabolism at the cellular level. This is THE most important change you'll make for metabolic health.

### Action Items
- Perform kitchen PUFA audit: scan all labels for seed oils (soybean, canola, corn, sunflower, safflower, cottonseed, grapeseed, rice bran)
- Practice label reading at grocery store: identify 10 "healthy-looking" products with hidden PUFAs
- Learn restaurant PUFA detection strategies (anything fried, sautéed, or "grilled" likely uses seed oils)
- Download PUFA database to check foods you eat regularly
- Understand why PUFAs are uniquely destructive: double bonds oxidize easily, create free radicals, suppress thyroid

---

## Module 3: The Sugar Truth (What They Got Backwards)

**Duration:** 30 minutes | **Priority:** ⭐⭐

### The Bottom Line
Glucose isn't the enemy—it's essential for thyroid function and metabolism. The real problem is high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) combined with PUFAs. You can eat rice, potatoes, fruit, and even white sugar without guilt when you eliminate PUFAs.

### Action Items
- Study Good Sugar vs Bad Sugar Chart (understand glucose vs fructose vs HFCS differences)
- Read Thyroid-Glucose Connection explainer (understand why low-carb diets kill thyroid function)
- Complete "Permission to Eat Sugar" mindset shift worksheet (release carb fear and decades of conditioning)
- Start eating strategic carbs without guilt: white rice, potatoes, fruit, honey, white sugar in coffee
- Understand the metabolic logic: glucose + no PUFAs = metabolic fuel; glucose + PUFAs = metabolic disaster

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Phase 2: Experimentation">

## Module 4: Reading Your Body (The Signals That Matter)

**Duration:** 45 minutes | **Priority:** ⭐⭐⭐ MOST IMPORTANT

### The Bottom Line
Your body speaks through temperature, pulse, energy, and digestion. These signals are more reliable than studies, experts, or diet dogma. Learn to listen to them and trust what your body tells you over what anyone else says.

### Action Items
- **Get equipment:** Digital thermometer (take oral temperature 3x daily for baseline)
- **Track baseline for 7 days before making diet changes:**
  - Morning temperature (upon waking)
  - Mid-day temperature
  - Evening temperature
  - Resting pulse rate (2x daily)
  - Energy levels throughout day (1-10 scale)
  - Digestion patterns and how you feel after meals
- **Identify your metabolic position:**
  - Healthy metabolism: 97.8-98.6°F, 70-85 bpm pulse, stable energy, good digestion
  - Mildly suppressed: 97.0-97.7°F, 60-69 bpm pulse, afternoon crashes, some bloating
  - Significantly suppressed: <97°F, <60 bpm pulse, constant fatigue, chronic digestive issues
- Learn what each signal means and how to interpret changes
- Use Body Signal Tracking Sheet to log data

## Module 5: PUFA Elimination Protocol

**Duration:** 1 hour + 7 days implementation | **Priority:** ⭐⭐⭐ MOST IMPORTANT

### The Bottom Line
This is the single most impactful action in the entire course. Eliminate 90% of PUFAs in one week through systematic kitchen cleanout, restocking with safe fats, learning to cook at home, and mastering strategic restaurant ordering.

### 7-Day Action Plan

**Day 1:** Kitchen Cleanout
- Pull every food from pantry, fridge, freezer
- Read every label for seed oils: soybean, canola, corn, sunflower, safflower, cottonseed, grapeseed, rice bran
- Create two piles: PUFA foods vs Safe foods
- Discard or donate all PUFA foods (yes, even expensive ones)

**Days 2-3:** Restock Kitchen
- **Safe fats:** Butter, ghee, coconut oil, extra virgin olive oil (for cold use), tallow, lard
- **Clean proteins:** Grass-fed beef, pasture-raised chicken, wild-caught fish, eggs, dairy
- **Safe carbs:** White rice, potatoes, fruit, honey, white sugar, sourdough bread
- **Condiments:** Check labels meticulously (most contain seed oils)

**Days 4-5:** Master Home Cooking
- **Breakfast options:** Eggs cooked in butter, fruit with yogurt, toast with butter and honey
- **Lunch options:** Leftover dinner, rice bowl with meat and vegetables, simple sandwich
- **Dinner options:** Meat cooked in butter/ghee, white rice or potatoes, cooked vegetables in butter
- Keep it simple—you don't need fancy recipes

**Days 6-7:** Restaurant Practice
- Use ordering scripts: "Can you cook this in butter instead of vegetable oil?"
- Safe bets: Plain grilled meat (ask for butter), baked potato (bring own butter), rice, salad with olive oil
- Use allergy angle if needed: "I have a sensitivity to seed oils"
- Apply 90/10 rule: perfect at home, do your best (80-90%) when eating out

**Throughout Week:**
- Continue tracking body signals (temperature, pulse, energy, digestion)
- Notice any changes after 3-5 days (some people feel better immediately, others take 2-3 weeks)

## Module 6: The Experiment Library (Lego Blocks)

**Duration:** 1 hour to review, ongoing to implement | **Priority:** ⭐⭐⭐ MOST IMPORTANT

### The Bottom Line
You're not following a diet—you're running experiments. There are 20 pre-designed experiments ranging from easy to advanced. Test one at a time, track your body signals, and keep only what works for YOUR specific body.

### How to Run Experiments

**Step 1:** Choose Your First Experiment
- Start with EASY tier: Morning OJ, Add White Rice to Dinner, Coffee with Cream & Sugar
- Pick something that sounds interesting or addresses a current issue

**Step 2:** Set Up Experiment Parameters
- Define duration (usually 3-14 days depending on experiment)
- Establish baseline body signals before starting
- Decide success criteria (What would "working" look like? Higher temp? More energy? Better digestion?)

**Step 3:** Run the Experiment
- Make ONLY this one change (don't change multiple things at once)
- Track body signals daily using Body Signal Tracking Sheet
- Take notes on how you feel, energy patterns, digestion, mood

**Step 4:** Analyze Results
- Compare body signals: Did temperature increase? Energy improve? Digestion get better/worse?
- Look for patterns over the full experiment duration (don't judge after 1 day)
- Ask: Did this move me toward my goals?

**Step 5:** Make a Decision
- **Keep:** Integrate permanently into your protocol if it clearly helped
- **Modify:** Adjust the experiment (e.g., less quantity, different timing) and test again
- **Discard:** Drop it if it made you feel worse or didn't help

**Step 6:** Move to Next Experiment
- Progress from EASY → MEDIUM → ADVANCED as you build confidence
- Eventually design custom experiments using the framework provided

### Action Items
- Download Experiment Tracker template
- Choose and run first experiment from EASY tier this week
- Track results systematically
- Progress to MEDIUM experiments (Pro-Thyroid Breakfast, Strategic Salt, Liver Week) after completing 2-3 easy ones
- Try ADVANCED experiments (Beef/Orange Juice Reset, Thyroid Support Stack) only after establishing strong foundation

## Module 7: Thyroid & Hormones (Just Enough Theory)

**Duration:** 30 minutes | **Priority:** ⭐

### The Bottom Line
Your thyroid is the metabolic master switch controlling temperature, energy, hormones, and weight. Low-carb diets destroy thyroid function by signaling starvation mode. PUFAs block thyroid hormone conversion. Glucose, selenium, iodine, zinc, and vitamin A support thyroid health.

### Key Concepts to Understand

**The 4 Thyroid Hormones:**
- TSH (brain signal to thyroid)
- T4 (storage form, inactive)
- T3 (active form that does the work)
- Reverse T3 (brake pedal that blocks T3)

**Why Low-Carb Destroys Thyroid:**
1. Brain detects low glucose → stress response
2. Body adapts by lowering T3 conversion (conserve energy)
3. Reverse T3 increases (blocks remaining T3)
4. Result: low body temp, low energy, weight loss stalls

**Why PUFAs Suppress Thyroid:**
- Block conversion of T4 → T3
- Increase Reverse T3 production
- Damage mitochondria (where thyroid hormones work)
- Create chronic inflammation

**Thyroid Support Nutrients:**
- **Selenium:** 2-3 Brazil nuts daily (needed for T4→T3 conversion)
- **Iodine:** Seafood, seaweed, iodized salt
- **Zinc:** Red meat, shellfish
- **Vitamin A (retinol):** Liver, egg yolks, butter
- **Adequate carbs:** 150g+ daily minimum for most people

### Action Items
- Download Thyroid Function One-Pager for quick reference
- Eat 2-3 Brazil nuts daily (selenium)
- Include seafood 2-3x per week (iodine)
- Eat liver once per week or take liver capsules (vitamin A)
- Ensure adequate carb intake (minimum 150g daily, more if active or metabolically suppressed)
- Recognize signs of suppressed thyroid: low temperature (<97.8°F), constant fatigue, constipation, depression, hair loss, dry skin, irregular periods, inability to lose weight
- Understand thyroid-sex hormone connection: low thyroid = low testosterone, estrogen, progesterone

## Module 8: Building Your Personal Protocol

**Duration:** 45 minutes | **Priority:** ⭐⭐

### The Bottom Line
Synthesize all your experiment results into a personalized eating protocol. This is YOUR protocol, not dogma—it evolves as your body signals change over time. Document what works, define your non-negotiables, and set adjustment triggers.

### Action Items

**Step 1: Review Experiment Results**
- Look back at all experiments you've run
- Identify what consistently improved temperature, energy, digestion
- Notice what made you feel worse or had no effect

**Step 2: Identify Your Building Blocks**
- **Fats:** What ratio of butter/ghee/coconut oil/olive oil works best for you?
- **Carbs:** How many grams daily? What timing (morning, evening, both)? Which types (rice, potatoes, fruit)?
- **Protein:** How much do you need? Which sources feel best?
- **Micronutrients:** Which foods/supplements support your specific needs?

**Step 3: Define Non-Negotiables**
- Example: "Zero seed oils 90%+ of the time"
- Example: "Minimum 150g carbs daily"
- Example: "Body temperature above 97.8°F"
- Example: "Cook at home 5+ nights per week"

**Step 4: Create Daily Structure**
- **Sample breakfast:** [Your ideal breakfast based on experiments]
- **Sample lunch:** [Your ideal lunch]
- **Sample dinner:** [Your ideal dinner]
- **Snacks:** [What works for you when needed]

**Step 5: Define Flexibility Rules**
- Where can you be flexible without issues?
- What situations require strict adherence?
- How do you handle the 10% (social events, travel, etc.)?

**Step 6: Identify Monitoring Signals**
- **Temperature targets:** [Your goal range]
- **Energy expectations:** [What "good energy" looks like for you]
- **Digestion standards:** [What normal digestion feels like]

**Step 7: Set Adjustment Triggers**
- Example: "If temp drops below 97.5°F for 3+ days → increase carbs by 50g"
- Example: "If energy crashes in afternoon → add carbs at lunch"
- Example: "If can't sleep → reduce evening carbs"

**Step 8: Test and Refine**
- Follow protocol for 14 days
- Track body signals
- Adjust based on results
- Repeat until you find your sustainable pattern

## Module 9: Social Situations & Real Life

**Duration:** 30 minutes | **Priority:** ⭐

### The Bottom Line
You can follow your protocol at home, but you also need to navigate restaurants, family dinners, travel, and social judgment without stress or obsession. The 90/10 rule makes this sustainable long-term.

### Action Items

**Restaurant Strategies**

**Safe Restaurant Types:**
- Steakhouses (butter-cooked steak, baked potato)
- Authentic Mexican (rice, beans, grilled meat, ask for lard/butter)
- Japanese (sushi, sashimi, rice, teriyaki without sauce)
- Italian (pasta with olive oil, ask about cooking oils)
- Mediterranean (grilled meat, rice, olive oil)

**Ordering Scripts:**
- "Can you cook this in butter instead of vegetable oil?"
- "I have a sensitivity to seed oils—can you help me order safely?"
- "Can I get this grilled with no oil, and a side of butter?"
- "What do you cook your [item] in?" (then decide based on answer)

**Safest Emergency Orders (Any Restaurant):**
- Plain grilled or baked meat (ask for butter on the side)
- Baked potato (bring your own butter if needed)
- White rice (usually safe)
- Salad with olive oil and vinegar (no dressing)

**Social & Family Situations**

**Handling Questions:**
- Keep it simple: "I feel better avoiding seed oils" (don't lecture)
- Use health angle: "My energy is so much better this way"
- Deflect: "It's boring—how's [change subject]?"
- Be vague: "Just trying some new things"

**Handling Judgment:**
- Remember: You don't owe anyone an explanation
- Stay calm and confident
- Don't try to convince anyone
- Let your results speak for themselves over time

**Being "Difficult" Without Guilt:**
- It's okay to have preferences
- You're not being difficult—you're taking care of yourself
- Restaurants exist to serve customers (they'll accommodate)
- True friends/family want you to feel good

**Travel Planning**

**Pack Travel Snacks:**
- Cheese sticks
- Dark chocolate (70%+ cacao with minimal ingredients)
- Fruit (apples, bananas, oranges)
- Hard-boiled eggs
- Rice cakes with nut butter packets

**Find Restaurants on the Road:**
- Use Google Maps to search "steakhouse near me"
- Research ahead of time if possible
- Look for independent restaurants (more willing to customize)
- Ask hotel staff for recommendations

**The 90/10 Rule in Action:**
- **90% compliance at home:** Perfect adherence, zero stress, full control
- **10% flexibility when out:** Do your best, don't obsess, enjoy life
- Remember: Stress damages your metabolism MORE than occasional seed oils

## Module 10: Supplements (What Matters, What Doesn't)

**Duration:** 30 minutes | **Priority:** ⭐

### The Bottom Line
Most supplements are unnecessary and food should always come first. Only add 1-3 targeted supplements if you have specific deficiencies or issues. Skip the supplement trap—you don't need 20 bottles.

### Action Items

**Audit Current Supplements**
For each supplement you're taking, ask:
- Why am I taking this?
- Is it actually helping? (Do I feel different?)
- Can I get this from food instead?
- What would happen if I stopped?

**Supplements That Actually Matter (Only If Needed)**

1. **Vitamin D3** (only if low sun exposure)
   - Test levels first (aim for 50-70 ng/mL)
   - Dose: 2,000-5,000 IU daily with food
   - Take with K2 if high-dose

2. **Magnesium** (if high stress or poor sleep)
   - Glycinate form (best absorbed, doesn't cause diarrhea)
   - Dose: 200-400mg before bed
   - Food sources: dark leafy greens, pumpkin seeds, dark chocolate

3. **Vitamin K2** (if taking high-dose vitamin D)
   - Helps direct calcium to bones vs arteries
   - Dose: 100-200 mcg daily
   - Food sources: natto, gouda cheese, egg yolks

4. **Liver Capsules** (if you won't eat liver)
   - Best whole-food multivitamin (vitamin A, B vitamins, iron, copper)
   - Dose: 3-6 capsules daily
   - Or just eat 4oz liver once per week

5. **Salt** (if under-salted or low blood pressure)
   - Most people need MORE salt, not less
   - Use good quality: sea salt, Redmond Real Salt, Himalayan
   - To taste on all foods

**Maybe Consider (Context-Dependent)**

- **Selenium:** 2-3 Brazil nuts daily (better than pill)
- **Zinc:** If vegetarian/vegan or frequent illness (15-30mg)
- **Vitamin A (retinol):** If not eating liver/egg yolks (10,000 IU)
- **Collagen:** If joint pain or skin issues (10-20g daily)

**Skip Entirely**

- Multivitamins (synthetic, poorly absorbed, unnecessary)
- B-complex (unless specific deficiency confirmed)
- Greens powders (just eat vegetables)
- Probiotics (fix gut through PUFA elimination first)
- Fat burners (metabolic support comes from diet)
- Exogenous ketones (unnecessary and expensive)

**How to Test Supplements**

1. Add ONE supplement at a time
2. Track body signals for 2 weeks
3. Ask: Do I feel different? Temperature change? Energy improve?
4. Keep only if clearly helping
5. Reassess every 3 months: Do I still need this?

**Remember:** Food > Supplements, always.

## Module 11: The Meditative Practice (Mindset)

**Duration:** 30 minutes | **Priority:** ⭐⭐

### The Bottom Line
This is a lifelong practice, not a temporary diet with an end date. Shift from following external rules to trusting internal body wisdom. Daily awareness of body signals is a form of meditation. Your body is the ultimate authority—not studies, not experts, not dogma.

### Action Items

**Shift 1: Diet → Practice**
- **Diet thinking:** Temporary, restrictive, has end goal, external rules
- **Practice thinking:** Ongoing, liberating, evolves with you, internal wisdom

**Shift 2: Develop Embodied Meditation (Daily Practice)**

Total time: 7-10 minutes spread throughout the day

**Morning (2 minutes):**
- Take oral temperature
- Notice: Do I feel warm or cold?
- Assess: How did I sleep? (quality, not just hours)
- Set intention: What will I pay attention to today?

**Before Each Meal (30 seconds):**
- Pause before eating
- Ask: Am I actually hungry? Or eating from habit/stress/boredom?

**After Each Meal (30 seconds):**
- Notice: Do I feel comfortable and satisfied? Or bloated and heavy?
- Observe: Energy rising or crashing?

**Mid-day (1 minute):**
- Take temperature again
- Check in: What's my energy level right now? (1-10 scale)
- Notice patterns: When do I feel best/worst?

**Evening (3 minutes):**
- Reflect: What worked today? What didn't?
- Observe: What did I eat? How did I feel?
- Plan: What do I want to experiment with tomorrow?

**Shift 3: The 3-Question Daily Check-In**

1. **How did I feel today?** (Temperature, energy, digestion, mood)
2. **What did I eat?** (Foods, timing, amounts)
3. **What do I want to experiment with tomorrow?** (Adjustments, tests, curiosities)

**Shift 4: Practice One Meal Meditation This Week**
- Eat slowly (put fork down between bites)
- Notice flavors, textures, temperature
- Be fully present (no phone, TV, computer)
- Observe how your body responds in real-time

**Shift 5: Work Through Mindset Shifts (Journaling)**

Journal on these questions:
- What am I afraid will happen if I trust my body?
- Where did I learn not to trust myself?
- What would change if I believed my body's signals over expert advice?
- How does it feel to be my own authority?

**The Spiritual Dimension**

This practice is ultimately about:
- Self-trust vs external validation
- Body wisdom vs intellectual knowledge
- Presence vs distraction
- Liberation vs rule-following

Awareness of your body is meditation. Connection to your body is spiritual practice. Trusting yourself is freedom.

## Module 12: Long-Term Maintenance (The 90/10 Rule)

**Duration:** 45 minutes | **Priority:** ⭐⭐⭐ MOST IMPORTANT

### The Bottom Line
Sustaining this for life requires NOT obsessing. After establishing your protocol and body awareness, switch to minimal tracking (weekly temperature checks, monthly check-ins). Maintain 90% compliance at home, stay flexible for the 10% (life happens), and never stop listening to your body as it evolves.

### Action Items

**Commit to 90/10 Rule**

- **90% compliance at home:** Zero stress, full control, perfect adherence
- **10% flexibility for LIFE:** Social events, travel, special occasions, spontaneity, enjoyment

This isn't cheating—this is sustainability. Stress damages your metabolism MORE than occasional seed oil exposure.

**Switch from Daily Tracking to Minimal Long-Term Tracking**

**After 8 weeks, reduce to:**

**Weekly (5 minutes):**
- Take temperature 1-2x per week
- Just confirm it's staying in healthy range (97.8-98.6°F)
- Note if anything feels off

**Monthly (10 minutes):**
- Full check-in on temperature, pulse, energy, digestion, mood
- Review: What's working? What needs adjustment?
- Journal: Any patterns or changes?

**Stop daily tracking entirely** after you've built body awareness—you'll FEEL when something is off.

**Know When to Experiment vs Stabilize**

**Experiment When:**
- You hit a plateau (progress stalled)
- Life circumstances change (new job, moved, different activity level)
- You're curious about something
- Body signals indicate need for adjustment

**Stabilize When:**
- Highly stressed or busy
- Traveling extensively
- Going through major life change
- Happy with current results and just want to maintain

**Adjust Protocol Seasonally**

- **Winter:** More carbs, more fats, warming foods, heavier meals
- **Summer:** More hydration, more fruit, lighter proteins, smaller meals
- **Spring/Fall:** Transition gradually, notice what your body asks for

**Have a Recovery Protocol for Life Disruptions**

When life happens (travel, holidays, illness, stress):

1. **Don't panic** (one week "off" won't undo months of healing)
2. **Return to basics:**
   - Zero seed oils (the ONE non-negotiable)
   - Enough carbs (don't restrict)
   - Regular meals (don't skip)
3. **Give it time** (1-2 weeks to normalize)
4. **Learn from it** (What triggered the disruption? How can you adapt?)
5. **Move forward** (no guilt, no shame, just curiosity)

**Avoid Zealotry Trap**

- Don't preach to others unsolicited
- Share your experience ONLY if someone asks
- Let your results speak for themselves
- Stay humble—your body is unique, what works for you may not work for others
- Keep learning and adapting (science evolves, your body changes)
- Remember: Dogma is the enemy of experimentation

**Create Quarterly Check-In Ritual**

Every 3 months, do a full review:

1. **Temperature trends:** Staying in optimal range?
2. **Energy patterns:** Consistent throughout day?
3. **Digestion:** Comfortable and regular?
4. **Mood/sleep:** Stable and restorative?
5. **Body composition:** Moving toward goals?
6. **What's working?** (Keep doing this)
7. **What needs adjustment?** (Experiment with this)
8. **What am I curious about?** (Try this next)

**Document Your Maintenance Protocol**

Write down your long-term structure:

**My Non-Negotiables:**
- [e.g., Zero seed oils 95% of time]
- [e.g., Minimum 150g carbs daily]
- [e.g., Weekly temperature check]

**My Daily Structure:**
- [Typical breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks]

**My Flexibility Rules:**
- [When and how I'm flexible]
- [10% situations that don't stress me]

**When to Experiment:**
- [Triggers that signal need for adjustment]

**When to Stabilize:**
- [Situations where I just maintain]

**Recovery Protocol:**
- [What I do after disruptions]

### The Ultimate Goal

You're building a sustainable relationship with food and your body that will serve you for DECADES, not weeks. This is metabolic health for life, not a 12-week transformation program.
